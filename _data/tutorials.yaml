The issue is that the track purchase key doesn't align with the primary key for the album table.  However, since the value of the track purchase contains the id of the album, you can extract the album id from the track purchase and complete a foreign key join against the album table."

  introduction: "Given a topic of click events on a website, there are various ways that we can process it. As well as simply counting the number of clicks in a regular time frame (using hopping or tumbling windows), we can also perform sessionization on the data. Here the length of the time window is based on the concept of a session, which is defined based on a period of inactivity. A given user might visit a website multiple times a day, but in distinct visits. Using session windows, we can analyze the number of clicks and duration per visit."

  introduction: "Kafka Connect is the integration API for Apache Kafka. It enables you to stream data from source systems (such databases, message queues, SaaS platforms, and flat files) into Kafka, and from Kafka to target systems. When you stream data into Kafka you often need to set the key correctly for partitioning and application logic reasons. In this example there is data about cities in a database, and we want to key the resulting Kafka message by the city_id field. There are different ways to set the key correctly and these tutorials will show you how. It will also cover how to declare the schema and use Kafka Streams to process the data using SpecificAvro. "

  introduction: "During the development of event streaming applications, it is very common to have situations where some streams or tables are not receiving some events that has been sent to it. Often this happens because there was an deserialization error due to the event not being in the right format, but that is not so trivial to figure out. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that monitors a stream of sensors. Any deserialization error that happens in this stream will be made available in another stream that can be queried to check errors."
