  introduction: "Kafka Connect is the integration API for Apache Kafka. It enables you to stream data from source systems (such databases, message queues, SaaS platforms, and flat files) into Kafka, and from Kafka to target systems. When you stream data into Kafka you often need to set the key correctly for partitioning and application logic reasons. In this example there is data about cities in a database, and we want to key the resulting Kafka message by the city_id field. There are different ways to set the key correctly and these tutorials will show you how. It will also cover how to declare the schema and use Kafka Streams to process the data using SpecificAvro. "

  introduction: "During the development of event streaming applications, it is very common to have situations where some streams or tables are not receiving some events that has been sent to it. Often this happens because there was an deserialization error due to the event not being in the right format, but that is not so trivial to figure out. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that monitors a stream of sensors. Any deserialization error that happens in this stream will be made available in another stream that can be queried to check errors."

Incremental functions include count, sum, min, and max. An average aggregation cannot be computed incrementally. However, as this tutorial shows, it can be implemented by composing incremental functions, namely count and sum. Consider a topic with events that represent ratings of movies.

  slug: "/message-ordering"
  question: "How can I maintain the order of messages and prevent message duplication in a Kafka topic partition?"
  introduction: "If your application needs to maintain ordering of messages with no duplication, you can enable your Apache Kafka producer for idempotency. An idempotent producer has a unique producer ID and uses sequence IDs for each message, which allows the broker to ensure it is committing ordered messages with no duplication, on a per partition basis."

  introduction: "A common pattern for fraudsters is to disguise transactions under the name of a popular company, the idea being that the chances of them being recognized is very low. For example, transactions labeled Verizon, Citibank, USPS, etc., are likely to look similar and blend in.  This tutorial shows you how to identify this pattern of behavior by detecting 'abnormal' transactions that occur within a window of time

                 There will normally be a group of such transactions that occur within a 24-hour period. When it comes to fraud detection, financial institutions will categorize this behavior as unusual and alert their fraud team to investigate immediately. Other example use cases include detecting atm fraud or unusual credit card activity."

  question: "What is the difference between using the timestamp from the record metadata and using the timestamp within the record payload?"
  introduction: "By default, time-based aggregations in Kafka Streams and ksqlDB (<a href=\"https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/create-tumbling-windows/ksql.html\">tumbling windows</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/create-hopping-windows/ksql.html\">hopping windows</a>, etc.) operate on the timestamp in the record metadata, which could be either 'CreateTime' (producer system time) or 'LogAppendTime' (broker system time), depending on the <a href=\"https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#message.timestamp.type\">message.timestamp.type</a> configuration value. 'CreateTime' helps with event-time semantics, but there may be use cases where the desired event time is a timestamp embedded inside the record payload. This tutorial shows you how to use the timestamp either from the record metadata or from a field in the record payload."

Although the Kafka Streams API does not natively include any notion of a TTL (Time To Live) for KTables, this tutorial shows you how to expire message by making clever use of tombstones and writing them out to topics underlying the KTable, using a state store containing TTLs"
