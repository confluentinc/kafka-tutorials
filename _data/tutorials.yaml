  question: "How can you stream data from a source system (such as a database) into Kafka using Kafka Connect, and add a key to the data as part of the ingestion?"
  introduction: "Kafka Connect is the integration API for Apache Kafka. It enables you to stream data from source systems (such as databases, message queues, SaaS platforms, and flat files) into Kafka, and from Kafka to target systems. When you stream data into Kafka, you often need to set the key correctly for partitioning and application logic reasons. In this example, we have a database containing data about cities, and we want to key the resulting Kafka messages by the city_id field. This tutorial will show you different ways of setting the key correctly. It will also cover how to declare the schema and use Kafka Streams to process the data using SpecificAvro."

  introduction: "During the development of event streaming applications, it is very common to have situations where some streams or tables are not receiving some events that have been sent to them. Often this happens because there was a deserialization error due to the event not being in the right format, but that is not so trivial to figure out. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that monitors a stream of sensors. Any deserialization error that happens in this stream will be made available in another stream that can be queried to check errors."

  introduction: "Kafka Streams natively supports \"incremental\" aggregation functions, in which the aggregation result is updated based on the values captured by each window. Incremental functions include `count()`, `sum()`, `min()`, and `max()`. An average aggregation cannot be computed incrementally. However, as this tutorial shows, it can be implemented by composing incremental functions, namely `count()` and `sum()`. Consider a topic with events that represent movie ratings. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that calculates and maintains a running average rating for each movie."

  question: "If you have time series events in a Kafka topic, how can you find anomalous events?"
  introduction: "A common technique of fraudsters is to disguise transactions under the name of a popular company, the idea being that the chances of them being recognized is very low. For example, transactions labeled Verizon, Citibank, or USPS are likely to look similar and blend in with legitimate transactions. This tutorial shows you how to identify this pattern of behavior by detecting 'abnormal' transactions that occur within a window of time.

                 Normally, a group of these transactions will occur within a 24 hour period. In fraud detection, financial institutions will categorize this behavior as unusual and alert their fraud team to investigate immediately. Other example use cases include detecting ATM fraud or unusual credit card activity."

  introduction: "By default, time-based aggregations in Kafka Streams and ksqlDB (<a href=\"https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/create-tumbling-windows/ksql.html\">tumbling windows</a>, <a href=\"https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/create-hopping-windows/ksql.html\">hopping windows</a>, etc.) operate on the timestamp in the record metadata, which could be either 'CreateTime' (the producer system time) or 'LogAppendTime' (the broker system time), depending on the <a href=\"https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#message.timestamp.type\">message.timestamp.type</a> configuration value. 'CreateTime' helps with event time semantics, but in some use cases, the desired event time is a timestamp embedded inside the record payload. This tutorial shows you how to use a timestamp retrieved either from the record metadata or from a field in the record payload."

  title: "How to implement TTL-based cleanup to expire data in a KTable created via aggregate"
  meta-description: "implement TTLs to expire data in the middle of a topology"
  slug: "/schedule-ktable-ttl-aggregate"
  question: "How can you periodically expire KTable records in the middle of a topology created using `aggregate()` or other stateful functions?"
  introduction: "You have a KStreams application which creates KTables in the middle of a topology, using the `aggregate()` function, and the state store grows over time. An example of this type of KTable usage is in a workflow application scenario, where `aggregate()` is used to handle a fixed set of updates to a certain workflow instance. Once the workflow is completed, this data is no longer needed in the state store. In other data aggregation use cases, you may simply want to remove older data to keep the state store size manageable. Although the Kafka Streams API does not natively include a notion of a TTL (Time To Live) for KTables, this tutorial shows you a way to manage the size of state stores that underlie KTables built on `aggregate()` steps.<br><br>
In a previous tutorial, we showed how to purge KTables which are created directly from an input topic. See <a href='https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/schedule-ktable-ttl/kstreams.html'>Expire data in a KTable with TTLs</a>.
<br><br>
The example shows a fixed TTL per key, based on the last update for that key. This may not serve all needs, but it is sufficient to illustrate the
mechanism by which we can purge data from a KTable. The transformer uses a state store to store the last updated time seen for a key,
and periodically (via a punctuator) scans its list of keys to see if any of them have exceeded a configured cutoff period (TTL). If they have met the condition for purging, then a
signal (via a wrapper object) is sent onward in the pipeline to the downstream `aggregate()` function, so that the key is removed from the KTable's own internal store. This is because the `groupBy()` API will swallow a null key or null value.
<br><br>
For a refresh on scheduling logic using a punctuator, have a look at the <a href='https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams.html'>Scheduling Operations</a> tutorial."

  slug: "/optimize-producer-throughput"
  question: "How can you optimize your Kafka producer application for throughput?"
  introduction: "When optimizing for performance, you'll typically need to consider tradeoffs between throughput and latency. Because of Kafka’s design, it isn't hard to write large volumes of data into it. But many of the Kafka configuration parameters have default settings that optimize for latency. If your use case calls for higher throughput, this tutorial walks you through how to use `kafka-producer-perf-test` to measure baseline performance and tune your producer for large volumes of data."

  meta-description: "handling multiple event types"

  question: "How can you have multiple event types in a topic and maintain topic-name subject constraints?"
  introduction: "You have distinct but related event types and you want to produce them to the same topic, but you also want to maintain topic-name subject constraints. Why produce different events to the different
  same topic? One reason would be you have low-traffic topics and you'd like to consolodate them to reduce overhead for the brokers.  Or you need to get the exact order of different events
  and by producing them to the same topic you are guaranteed correct ordering per-partition.<br/>  

  To do multiple events with topic-name constraints you'll need to use 
  <a href='https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/serdes-develop/index.html#schema-references'>schema references</a>, which is a schema that contains a field representing an object which is reference to another another schema.
  In this tutorial you'll learn about using schema references with both Protobuf and Avro. <br/>
