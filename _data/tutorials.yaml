  problem: "you have a Kafka topic and you want to change the key of the messages. It may be there is no key and you want to set one, or there is a key but you want to change it to a field from the record value."
  introduction: "Suppose you have an unkeyed stream of movie ratings from movie-goers. Because the stream is not keyed, ratings for the same movie aren't guaranteed to be placed into the same partition. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that creates a new topic keyed by the movie's name. When the key is consistent, it becomes possible to process these ratings at scale and in parallel."

  introduction: "Consider a stream of customer information events keyed by id. Each event contains a few attributes, including the customer's phone number. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that rekeys the topic by the area address of the phone number. Customers of the same area code will be placed into the same partition in the new topic."
