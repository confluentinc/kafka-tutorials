  slug: "/transform-a-stream-of-events"
  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to change each event in some way and put it in a new topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent movies. Each event has a single attribute that combines its title and its release year into a string. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that creates a new topic with the title and release date turned into their own attributes."

filtering:

  meta-description: "Learn to filter a stream of events"
  slug: "/filter-a-stream-of-events"
  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to filter some of them out so that only those you're interested in appear in another topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent book publications. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that creates a new topic which only contains the events for a particular author."

splitting:

  meta-description: "Learn to split a stream of events into substreams"
  slug: "/split-a-stream-of-events-into-substreams"
  problem: "you have events in a single Kafka topic, and you want to split it so that the events are placed into subtopics."
  introduction: "Suppose that you have a Kafka topic representing appearances of an actor or actress in a film, with each event denoting the genre. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that splits the stream into substreams based on the genre. We'll have a topic for drama films, a topic for fantasy films, and a topic for everything else."

merging:

  slug: "/merge-many-streams-into-one-stream"
  problem: "you have many Kafka topics with events in them, and you want to merge them all into a single topic."
  introduction: "Suppose that you have a set of Kafka topics representing songs being played of a particular genre. You might have a topic for rock songs, another for classical songs, and so forth. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that merges all of the song play events into a single topic."

joining-stream-table:
  title: "How to join a stream and a table together"
  meta-description: "Learn to join a stream and a table together"
  slug: "/join-a-stream-to-a-table"
  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic and a table of reference data. You want to join each event in the stream to a piece of data in the table based on a common key."
  introduction: "Suppose you have a set of movies that have been released and a stream of ratings from movie-goers about how entertaining they are. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that joins each rating with content about the movie."

  meta-description: "Learn to join a table and a table together"
  slug: "/join-a-table-to-a-table"
  problem: "you have two Kafka topics representing current state for keys — in other words, reference data. You want to join between two of these tables on a common key."
  introduction: "Suppose you have a set of data about movies and want to add further details such as who the lead actor was. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that joins each movie to another set of data holding information about who the lead actor was for movies."

joining-stream-stream:
  title: "How to join a stream and a stream together"
  meta-description: "Learn to join a stream and a stream together"
  slug: "/join-a-stream-to-a-stream"
  problem: "you have two Kafka topics whose events share a common identifying attribute and correlate during some period of time. You want to join the topics together and create a new one based on that attribute, where the new events are enriched from the original topics."
  introduction: "Suppose you have two streams containing events for orders and shipments. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that joins these two streams to create a new, enriched one. The new stream will tell us which orders have been successfully shipped, how long it took for them to ship, and which warehouse they shipped from."

rekeying:

  meta-description: "Learn to rekey a stream"
  slug: "/rekey-a-stream"
  problem: "you have a Kafka topic and you want to change the key of the messages. It may be there is no key and you want to set one, or there is a key but you want to change it to a field from the record value."
  introduction: "Suppose you have an unkeyed stream of movie ratings from movie-goers. Because the stream is not keyed, ratings for the same movie aren't guaranteed to be placed into the same partition. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that creates a new topic keyed by the movie's name. When the key is consistent, it becomes possible to process these ratings at scale and in parallel."

  problem: "you have time-series events in a Kafka topic, and you want to group them into fixed-size, non-overlapping, contiguous time intervals."
  introduction: "Suppose you have a topic with events that represent ratings of movies. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that maintains tumbling windows counting the total number of ratings that each movie has received."

  problem: "you have a Kafka topic with the data serialized in a particular format, and you want to change the format to something else."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent movie releases. The events in the topic are formatted with JSON. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that creates a new topic with the same events, but formatted with Avro."
