  introduction: "Kafka Connect is the integration API for Apache Kafka. It enables you to stream data from source systems (such databases, message queues, SaaS platforms, and flat files) into Kafka, and from Kafka to target systems. When you stream data into Kafka you often need to set the key correctly for partitioning and application logic reasons. In this example there is data about cities in a database, and we want to key the resulting Kafka message by the city_id field. There are different ways to set the key correctly and these tutorials will show you how. It will also cover how to declare the schema and use Kafka Streams to process the data using SpecificAvro. "

  question: "How can I identify and manage deserialization errors that cause some events from a Kafka topic to not be written into a stream or table?"
  introduction: "During the development of event streaming applications, it is very common to have situations where some streams or tables are not receiving some events that has been sent to it. Often this happens because there was an deserialization error due to the event not being in the right format, but that is not so trivial to figure out. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that monitors a stream of sensors. Any deserialization error that happens in this stream will be made available in another stream that can be queried to check errors."

  introduction: "Kafka Streams natively supports \"incremental\" aggregation functions, in which the aggregation result is updated based on the values captured by each window. Incremental functions include count, sum, min, and max. An average aggregation cannot be computed incrementally. However, as this tutorial shows, it can be implemented by composing incremental functions, namely count and sum. Consider a topic with events that represent ratings of movies. In this tutorial, we'll write a program that calculates and maintains a running average rating for each movie."
