transforming:
  title: "Transform a stream of events"
  slug: "/recipes/transform-a-stream-of-events"
  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to change each event in some way and put it in a new topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent movies. Each event has a single attribute that combines its title and its release year into a string. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic with the title and release date turned into their own attributes."

filtering:
  title: "Filter a stream of events"
  slug: "/recipes/filter-a-stream-of-events"
  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to filter some of them out so that only those you're interested in appear in another topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent book publications. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic which only contains the events for a particular author."

splitting:
  title: "Split a stream of events into substreams"
  slug: "/recipes/split-a-stream-of-events-into-substreams"
  problem: "you have events in a single Kafka topic, and you want to split it so that the events are placed into subtopics."
  introduction: "Suppose that you have a Kafka topic representing appearances of an actor or actress in a film, with each event denoting the genre. In this recipe, we'll write a program that splits the stream into substreams based on the genre. We'll have a topic for drama films, a topic for fantasy films, and a topic for everything else."

merging:

  slug: "/recipes/merge-many-streams-into-one-stream"
  problem: "you have many Kafka topics with events in them, and you want to merge them all into a single topic."
  introduction: "Suppose that you have a set of Kafka topics representing songs being played of a particular genre. You might have a topic for rock songs, another for classical songs, and so forth. In this recipe, we'll write a program that merges all of the song play events into a single topic."

joining-stream-table:
  title: "Join a stream and a table together"
  slug: "/recipes/join-a-stream-to-a-table"
  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic and a table of reference data. You want to join each event in the stream to a piece of data in the table based on a common key."
  introduction: "Suppose you have a set of movies that have been released and a stream of ratings from movie-goers about how entertaining they are. In this recipe, we'll write a program that joins each rating with content about the movie."

joining-table-table:
  title: "Join a table and a table together"
  slug: "/recipes/join-a-table-to-a-table"
  problem: "you have two Kafka topics representing current state for keys â€” in other words, reference data. You want to join between two of these tables on a common key."
  introduction: "Suppose you have a set of data about movies and want to add further details such as who the lead actor was. In this recipe, we'll write a program that joins each movie to another set of data holding information about who the lead actor was for movies."

tumbling-windows:
  title: "Create tumbling windows"
  slug: "/recipes/create-tumbling-windows"
  problem: "you have time-series events in a Kafka topic, and you want to group them into fixed-size, non-overlapping, contiguous time intervals."
  introduction: "Suppose you have a topic with events that represent ratings of movies. In this recipe, we'll write a program that maintains tumbling windows counting the total number of ratings that each movie has received."
