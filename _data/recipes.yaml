  introduction: "Consider a topic of user events. Each has a variety of attributes, like the user's name, favorite number, and favorite color. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic which only contains events where the user's favorite color is green."

splitting:

  problem: "you have events in a single Kafka topic, and you want to split it so that the events are placed into subtopics."
  introduction: "Consider a topic of user events. Each has a variety of attributes, like the user's name and their current country. In this recipe, we'll write a program that splits the events based on the user's country and creates a new set of Kafka topics."

  introduction: "Suppose that you have a set of Kafka topics representing songs being played on a particular genre. You might have a topic for rock songs, another for classical songs, and so forth. In this recipe, we'll write a program that merges all of the song play events into a single topic."
