  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to change each event in some way and put it in a new topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent movies. Each event has a single attribute that combines its title and its release year into a string. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic with the title and release date turned into their own attributes."

  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to filter some of them out so that only those you're interested in appear in another topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent book publications. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic which only contains the events for a particular author."

  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to transform some of them out so that a new stream of events would be written into a new topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic with events that represent movies. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic which contains the same events but with one of the original fields now split into two different fields."

  problem: "you have events in a single Kafka topic, and you want to split it so that the events are placed into subtopics."
  introduction: "Suppose that you have a Kafka topic representing appearances of an actor or actress in a film, with each event denoting the genre. In this recipe, we'll write a program that splits the stream into substreams based on the genre. We'll have a topic for drama films, a topic for fantasy films, and a topic for everything else."

  problem: "you have many Kafka topics with events in them, and you want to merge them all into a single topic."
  introduction: "Suppose that you have a set of Kafka topics representing songs being played on a particular genre. You might have a topic for rock songs, another for classical songs, and so forth. In this recipe, we'll write a program that merges all of the song play events into a single topic."
