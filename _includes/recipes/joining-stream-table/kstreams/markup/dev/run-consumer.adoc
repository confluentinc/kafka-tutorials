Before you start producing ratings, it's a good idea to set up the consumer on the output topic. This way, as soon as you produce ratings (and they're joined to movies), you'll see the results right away. Run this to get ready to consume the rated movies:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You won't see any results until the next step.
