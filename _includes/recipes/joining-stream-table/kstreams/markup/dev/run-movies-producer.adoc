In a new terminal, run:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/console-producer-movies.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input. Copy and paste one line at a time and press enter to send it. Note that these lines contain hard tabs between the key and the value, so retyping them without the tab will not work.

Each line represents a movie we will be able to rate. To send all of the events below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw recipes/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/movies.json %}</code></pre>
