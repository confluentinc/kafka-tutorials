Run the following in a new terminal window. This process is the most fun if you can see this and the previous terminal (which is consuming the rated movies) at the same time. If your terminal program lets you do horizontal split panes, try it that way:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/console-producer-ratings.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the producer starts up, copy and paste these lines into the terminal. Try doing them one at a time, observing the results in the consumer terminal:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw recipes/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/ratings.json %}</code></pre>
+++++

Speaking of that consumer terminal, these are the results you should see there if you paste in all the movies and ratings as shown in this recipe:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw recipes/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/rated-movies.json %}</code></pre>
+++++

You have now joined a stream to a table! Well done.
