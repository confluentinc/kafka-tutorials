Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/JoinStreamToTableTest.java`. Testing a Kafka streams application requies a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

There is only one method in `JoinStreamToTableTest` annotated with `@Test`, and that is `testJoin()`. This method actually runs our Streams topology using the `TopologyTestDriver` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
