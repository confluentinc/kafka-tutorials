Now create the following file at <code>src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/JoinStreamToTableTest.java</code>. Testing a Kafka streams application requies a bit of test harness code, but happily the <code>org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver</code> class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

There is only one method in <code>JoinStreamToTableTest</code> annotated with <code>@Test</code>, and that is <code>testJoin()</code>. This method actually runs our Streams topology using the <code>TopologyTestDriver</code> and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
