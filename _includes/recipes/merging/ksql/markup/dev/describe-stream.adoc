To verify that our streams are connecting together as we hope they are, we can describe the stream that contains all the songs:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/merging/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/describe-stream.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield roughly the following output. Notice that our insert statements appear as writers to this stream:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/merging/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/describe-stream/output-0.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
