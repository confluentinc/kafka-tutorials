<div class="recipe-try-it-step">
  <h4 class="subtitle"><div>1. Initialize the project</div></h4>

  <p>To get started, make a new directory anywhere you'd like for this project:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/init.sh %}</code></pre>

  <p>Then make the following directories to set up its structure:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/make-dirs.sh %}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="recipe-try-it-step">
  <h4 class="subtitle"><div>2. Get Confluent Platform</div></h4>

  <p>Next, create the following <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to obtain Confluent Platform:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="dockerfile">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/docker-compose.yml %}</code></pre>

  <p>And launch it by running:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/docker-compose-up.sh %}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="recipe-try-it-step">
  <h4 class="subtitle"><div>3. Start the CLI and produce events to the input stream</div></h4>

  <p>To begin developing interactively, open up the KSQL CLI:<p/>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/start-cli.sh %}</code></pre>

  <p>First, you'll need to create a Kafka topic and stream to represent the actors. The following creates both in one shot:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/create-inputs.sql %}</code></pre>

  <p>Then produce the following events to the stream:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/populate-stream.sql %}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="recipe-try-it-step">
  <h4 class="subtitle"><div>4. Create a continuous query</div></h4>

  <p>Now that you have stream with some events in it, let's read them out. The first thing to do is set the following properties to ensure that you're reading from the beginning of the stream:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/set-properties.sql %}</code></pre>

  <p>Let's find all of the drama films. Issue the following transient query. This will block and continue to return results until it's limit is reached or you tell it to stop.</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/query-drama.sql %}</code></pre>

  <p>This should yield the following output:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/query-drama/output-0.log %}</code></pre>

  <p>You can also use negative matches, that is, messages that <em>don't</em> match the condition. Run this query to get a list of all films that aren't drama or fantasy.</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/query-not-drama-fantasy.sql %}</code></pre>

  <p>This should yield the following output:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/query-not-drama-fantasy/output-0.log %}</code></pre>

  <p>Since the output looks right, the next step is to make the queries continuous. Issue the following to create three new streams that are continously populated by the queries:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/continuous-select.sql %}</code></pre>

  <p>To check that it's working, print out the contents of one of the output stream's underlying topic.</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>

  <p>This should yield the following output:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/print-output-topic/output-0.log %}</code></pre>

  <p>Try dropping the <code>LIMIT</code> from the print command so that it runs indefinitely. To see how any new message on the source stream is automatically routed to the correct target stream, open a new CLI session and insert a record like we did above.</p>
</div>

<div class="recipe-try-it-step">
  <h4 class="subtitle"><div>5. Write your statements to a file</div></h4>

  <p>Now that you have a series of statements that's doing the right thing, the last step is to put them into a file so that they can be used outside the CLI session. Create a file at <code>src/statements.sql</code> with the following content:</p>
  <pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/splitting/ksql/code/src/statements.sql %}</code></pre>
</div>
