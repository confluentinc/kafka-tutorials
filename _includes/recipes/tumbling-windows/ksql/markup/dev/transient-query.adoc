As a bonus, we can prove to ourselves that the window boundaries are in fact 6 hour intervals. Run the following transient query, which uses the `TIMESTAMPTOSTRING` function to convert the UNIX timestamps into something that we can read:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/tumbling-windows/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/transient-query.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output should look similar to:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/tumbling-windows/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/transient-query/output-0.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
