Let's take a close look at the <code>buildTopology()</code> method, which uses the Kafka Streams DSL.</p>


The first thing the method does is create an instance of <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/StreamsBuilder.html">StreamsBuilder</a></code>, which is the helper object that lets us build our topology. 
  
First, we call the <code>stream()</code> method to create a <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html">KStream</a><String, Rating></code> object. The problem is that we can't make any assumptions about the key of this stream, so we have to repartition it explicitly. We use the <code>map()</code> method for that, creating a new <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/KeyValue.html">KeyValue</a></code> instance for each record, using the title as the new key.
    
Next we group the events by that new key by calling the <code>groupByKey()</code> method. We want to count the events that occur with each given key, so we must first define a tumbling window by calling <code>windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(10)))</code>. We then call <code>count()</code>, which directs the topology to count the grouped events that occur within each window. At this point in the toplogy, the result is a <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KTable.html"></a>KTable</a><<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/Windowed.html">Windowed</a><String>,Long></code>. We use the <code>map()</code> method to turn it into two easy-to-read strings, then emit the result to the output topic with the <code>to()</code> method. You might not always make that last call to <code>map()</code>, but for our purposes here, it makes the output a lot easier to read.
