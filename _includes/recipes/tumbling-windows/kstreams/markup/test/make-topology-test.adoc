Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/TumblingWindowTest.java`. Testing a Kafka streams application requies a bit of test harness code, but the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this easy.

There is only one method in `TumblingWindowTest` annotated with `@Test`, and that is `testWindows()`. This method actually runs our Streams topology using the `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/TopologyTestDriver.html[TopologyTestDriver]` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
