<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw recipes/rekeying/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/query-rekeyed-stream.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/rekeying/ksql/code/recipe-steps/dev/expected-query-rekeyed-stream.log %}</code></pre>
