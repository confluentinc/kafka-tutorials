Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/TransformStream.java`. Let's take a close look at the `buildTopology()` method, which uses the Kafka Streams DSL.

The first thing the method does is create an instance of `StreamsBuilder`, which is the helper object that lets us build our topology. Next we call the `stream()` method, which creates a `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html[KStream]` object (called `rawMovies` in this case) out of an underlying Kafka topic. Note the type of that stream is `Long, RawMovie`, because the topic contains the raw movie objects we want to transform. RawMovie's `title` field contains the title and the release year together, which we want to make into separate fields in a new object.

We get that transforming work done with the next line, which is a call to the `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html#map-org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KeyValueMapper-[map()]` method. `map()` takes each input record and creates a new stream with transformed records in it. Its parameter is a single Java Lambda that takes the input key and value and returns an instance of the `KeyValue` class with the new record in it. This does two things. First, it rekeys the incoming stream, using the `movieId` as the key. We don't absolutely need to do that to accomplish the transformation, but it's easy enough to do at the same time, and it sets a useful key on the output stream, which is generally a good idea. Second, it calls the `convertRawMovie()` method to turn the `RawMovie` value into a `Movie`. This is the essence of the transformation. The `convertRawMovie()` method contains the sort of unpleasant string parsing that is a part of many stream processing pipelines, which we are happily able to encapsulate in a single, easily testable method. Any further stages we might build in the pipeline after this point are blissfully unaware that we ever had a string to parse in the first place.

Moreover, it's worth noting that we're calling `map()` and not `mapValues()`:
