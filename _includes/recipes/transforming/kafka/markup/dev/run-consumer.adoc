Now that we produced raw movies to the input topic, the Apache Kafka application that is running in the background should have picked them up and processed them accordingly. This means that if everything really worked, you should see the transformed movies in the output topic. Open another console to consume the records that have been produced by your application:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw recipes/transforming/kafka/code/recipe-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After the consumer starts, you should see the following messages. The prompt will hang, waiting for more events to arrive. To continue studying this recipe, send more events through the input terminal prompt. Otherwise, you can `Control-C` to exit the process.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw recipes/transforming/kafka/code/recipe-steps/dev/outputs/actual-movies.json %}</code></pre>
