From the Confluent Cloud Console, navigate to your Kafka cluster and then expand ``Data Integration`` in the lefthand navigation. From the ``Clients`` view, get the connection information customized to your cluster.

Create new credentials for your Kafka cluster, and then Confluent Cloud will show a configuration similar to below with your new credentials automatically populated (make sure ``show API keys`` is checked).
Copy and paste it into a `configuration/ccloud.properties` file on your machine.

NOTE: Do not directly copy and paste the above configuration. You must copy it from the Confluent Cloud Console so that it includes your Confluent Cloud information and credentials.
