1. After you log in to https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], click `Environments` in the lefthand navigation, click on `Add cloud environment`, and name the environment `learn-kafka`. Using a new environment keeps your learning resources separate from your other Confluent Cloud resources.

2. From the `Billing & payment` section in the menu, apply the promo code `CC100KTS` to receive an additional $100 free usage on Confluent Cloud (https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer[details]). To avoid having to enter a credit card, add an additional promo code `CONFLUENTDEV1`. With this promo code, you will not have to enter a credit card for 30 days or until your credits run out.

3. Click on https://confluent.cloud/learn[LEARN] and follow the instructions to launch a Kafka cluster and enable Schema Registry.
