Instead of running a local Kafka cluster, you may use https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], a fully managed Apache Kafka service.

1. Sign up for https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], a fully managed Apache Kafka service.
  
2. After you log in to Confluent Cloud Console, click `Environments` in the lefthand navigation, click on `Add cloud environment`, and name the environment `learn-kafka`. Using a new environment keeps your learning resources separate from your other Confluent Cloud resources.

3. From the `Billing & payment` section in the menu, apply the promo code `CC100KTS` to receive an additional $100 free usage on Confluent Cloud (https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer[details]). To avoid having to enter a credit card, add an additional promo code `CONFLUENTDEV1`. With this promo code, you will not have to enter a credit card for 30 days or until your credits run out.

4. Click on https://confluent.cloud/learn[LEARN] and follow the instructions to launch a Kafka cluster and enable Schema Registry.

Next, from the Confluent Cloud Console, click on `Clients` to get the cluster-specific configurations, e.g., Kafka cluster bootstrap servers and credentials, Confluent Cloud Schema Registry and credentials, etc., and set the appropriate parameters in your client application.
In the case of this tutorial, add the following properties to the client application's input properties file, substituting all curly braces with your Confluent Cloud values.

Now you're all set to run your streaming application locally, backed by a Kafka cluster fully managed by Confluent Cloud.
