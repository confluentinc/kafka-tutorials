From the Confluent Cloud UI, navigate to your Kafka cluster and click on ``Clients``.
Create credentials for the Kafka cluster and Schema Registry:

- ``Create Kafka cluster API key & secret``

- ``Create Schema Registry API key & secret``

Select ``Java`` as the client.
Confluent Cloud will show a configuration similar to below, but with your credentials populated (make sure ``show API keys`` is checked).
Copy and paste this configuration into a local `configuration/ccloud.properties` file on your local machine.

NOTE: do not directly copy and paste the above configuration. It must include your Confluent Cloud information and credentials.
