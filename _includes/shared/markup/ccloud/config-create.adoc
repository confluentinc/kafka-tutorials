From the Confluent Cloud Console, navigate to your Kafka cluster and then select ``Clients`` in the lefthand navigation. From the ``Clients`` view, click ``Set up a new client`` and get the connection information customized to your cluster.

Create new credentials for your Kafka cluster and Schema Registry, writing in appropriate descriptions so that the keys are easy to find and delete later. The Confluent Cloud Console will show a configuration similar to below with your new credentials automatically populated (make sure ``Show API keys`` is checked).
Copy and paste it into a `configuration/ccloud.properties` file on your machine.

NOTE: Do not directly copy and paste the above configuration. You must copy it from the Confluent Cloud Console so that it includes your Confluent Cloud information and credentials.
