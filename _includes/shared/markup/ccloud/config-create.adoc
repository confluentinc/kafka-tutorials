From the Confluent Cloud UI, navigate to your Kafka cluster and click on ``Clients`` and then select ``Java``.

Create new credentials for your Kafka cluster and Schema Registry, and then Confluent Cloud will show a configuration similar to below with your new credentials automatically populated (make sure ``show API keys`` is checked).
Copy and paste it into a `configuration/ccloud.properties` file on your machine.

NOTE: Do not directly copy and paste the above configuration. You must copy it from the UI so that it includes your Confluent Cloud information and credentials.
