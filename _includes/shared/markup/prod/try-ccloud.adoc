Instead of running a local Kafka cluster, you may use https://confluent.cloud[Confluent Cloud], a fully-managed Apache Kafka service.

First, create your Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud.
Use the promo code `C50INTEG` to receive an additional $50 free usage (https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer[details]).

Next, from the Confluent Cloud UI, click on `Tools & client config` to get the cluster-specific configurations, e.g. Kafka cluster bootstrap servers and credentials, Confluent Cloud Schema Registry and credentials, etc., and set the appropriate parameters in your client application.

Now you're all set to your run application locally while your Kafka topics and stream processing is backed to your Confluent Cloud instance.
