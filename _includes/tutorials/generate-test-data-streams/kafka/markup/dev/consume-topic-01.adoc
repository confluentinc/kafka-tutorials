With the connector running let's now inspect the data that's being generated to the Kafka topic. Here we'll use kcat, but you could use any Kafka consumer if you wanted.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/generate-test-data-streams/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/consume-topic-01.sh %}</code></pre>

You should see 5 messages and then the command will exit. Observe that the one message is being generated per second, which is what was specified in the `'max.interval'    = 1000` setting.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/generate-test-data-streams/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/consume-topic-01_expected.log %}</code></pre>

You can also run this without the `-c5` argument to see a continuous stream of messages. If you do this, press `Ctrl-C` to return to the command prompt.
