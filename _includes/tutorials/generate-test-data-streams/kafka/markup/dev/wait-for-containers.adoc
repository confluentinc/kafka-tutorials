Before continuing, you need to wait for all the containers to fully start up. Run this script which will wait for the final dependencies in the chain to be ready:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/generate-test-data-streams/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/wait-for-containers.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Once everything is ready you should see this, and get control back at your terminal:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/generate-test-data-streams/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/wait-for-containers_expected.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
