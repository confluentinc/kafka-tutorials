With the connector running let's now inspect the data that's being generated to the Kafka topic. ksqlDB's `PRINT` command will show the contents of a topic:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/generate-test-data-streams/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/consume-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see 5 messages and then the command will exit. Observe that the one message is being generated per second, which is what was specified in the `'max.interval'    = 1000` setting.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/generate-test-data-streams/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/consume-topic_expected.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

You can also run this without the `LIMIT 5` to see a continuous stream of messages. If you do this, press `Ctrl-C` to return to the ksqlDB prompt.
