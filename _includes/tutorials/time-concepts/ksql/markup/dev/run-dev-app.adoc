Now that you have an uberjar for the `KafkaProducerDevice` application, you can launch it locally.

After you run the previous command, the application will write some messages to Kafka and you should something like this on the console:

[source, text]
----
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785578301, Kafka timestamp 1606785579368
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785579482, Kafka timestamp 1606785580492

Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785583521, Kafka timestamp 1606785584528
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785584528, Kafka timestamp 1606785585533
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785585534, Kafka timestamp 1606785586544
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785586544, Kafka timestamp 1606785587551
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606785587552, Kafka timestamp 1606785588562

Note that the `payload eventTime` value is not the same as the `Kafka timestamp` valueâ€”this is working as expected.
It demonstrates how the end system may intentionally set an event time in the payload, and it will differ from the Kafka record metadata timestamp.
