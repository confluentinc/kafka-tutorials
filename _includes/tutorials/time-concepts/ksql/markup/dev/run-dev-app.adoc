Now that you have an uberjar for the `KafkaProducerDevice` application, you can launch it locally.

After you run the previous command, the application will write some messages to Kafka and you should something like this on the console:

[source, text]
----
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158066122, Kafka timestamp 1606158066184
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158067577, Kafka timestamp 1606158067582

Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158071611, Kafka timestamp 1606158071617
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158072623, Kafka timestamp 1606158072628
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158073629, Kafka timestamp 1606158073634
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158074635, Kafka timestamp 1606158074640
Record written to topic deviceEvents: payload eventTime 1606158075643, Kafka timestamp 1606158075648

Note that the `payload eventTime` value is not the same as the `Kafka timestamp` valueâ€”this is working as expected.
It demonstrates how the end system may intentionally set an event time in the payload, and it will differ from the Kafka record metadata timestamp.
