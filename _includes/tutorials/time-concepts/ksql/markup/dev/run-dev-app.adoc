Now that you have an uberjar for the KafkaProducerApplication, you can launch it locally.

After you run the previous command, the application will write some messages to Kafka and you should something like this on the console:

[source, text]

Note that the `payload eventTime` value is not the same as the `log timestamp` valueâ€”this is working as expected.
It demonstrates how the "event time" (or "wall-clock" time) in the payload, which is set by the application or end system, intentionally may differ from the "log timestamp" (or "ingestion" time), set by the Kafka broker when it writes the record to its log file.
