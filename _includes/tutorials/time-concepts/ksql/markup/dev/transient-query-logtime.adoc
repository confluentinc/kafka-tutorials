Letâ€™s inspect the events in this newly created `TEMPERATURE_READINGS_LOGTIME` stream by running a `SELECT` statement with an `EMIT CHANGES` clause, limited to 10.
It shows the payload fields `TEMPERATURE` and `EVENTTIME`, plus the `ROWTIME` which is a system-column in ksqlDB that is used for time-based aggregations.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query-logtime.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-logtime.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that for each row:

- The `EVENTTIME` value in ksqlDB corresponds exactly to the `payload eventTime`, a field within the record payload
- The `ROWTIME` value in ksqlDB corresponds exactly to the `Kafka timestamp` printed by the producer's callback, corresponding to the record metadata timestamp

Any time-based aggregations on this stream is based on `ROWTIME`, consequently this results in processing based on the timestamp in the Kafka record metadata (either `CreateTime` or `LogAppendTime`).
