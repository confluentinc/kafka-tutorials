Now let’s directly inspect that output topic using the `print` ksqlDB CLI command. We could also `SELECT * FROM MOVIE_TICKETS_SOLD`, but here we opt for a more direct approach.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print-output-topic.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that ksqlDB is storing the `TITLE` in the key of the Kafka message. It does this because `TITLE` is the primary key of the `MOVIE_TICKETS_SOLD` table.
If needed, a copy of `TITLE` can also be stored in the value by adding `AsValue(TITLE)` in the projection.
