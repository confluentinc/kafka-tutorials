Create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaProducerDevice.java`.
This is a Kafka Producer that writes messages to Kafka, and the payload of every message includes a field called `eventTime` which is dynamically calculated for each record.

[source, java]
----
eventTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
----

This `eventTime` is the event time, the point in time when an event or data record was originally created by the source or end system.
Achieving event-time semantics typically requires embedding timestamps in the data records at the time a data record is being produced.
