Achieving event-time semantics typically requires embedding timestamps into the data record at the time it is produced.
Write a Kafka Producer application that generates simulated device events and embeds a timestamp into the payload of every message.
The timestamp is written in an arbitrary field, in this case called `eventTime`, whose value represents the time at which the event occurred at the source.

[source, java]
----
eventTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
