Achieving event-time semantics typically requires embedding timestamps in the data records at the time it is produced.
So now write a Kafka Producer application that generates simulated device events, and embeds timestamps into the data record itself.
It writes messages to Kafka, and the payload of every message includes a field called `eventTime` whose value is the current time, or "event time", the point at which an event or data record was originally created by the source or end system.

[source, java]

eventTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
