Inspect the events in this newly created `TEMPERATURE_READINGS_EVENTTIME` stream by running:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query-eventtime.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-eventtime.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that for each row:

- The `ROWTIME` value in ksqlDB corresponds exactly to the `EVENTTIME`, which is the `payload eventTime`, a field within the record payload.

Any time-based aggregations on this stream is based on `ROWTIME`, consequently this results in processing based on event time.
