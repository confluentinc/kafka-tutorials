This should yield the following output:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/time-concepts/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-eventtime.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that for each row:

. The `EVENTTIME` value in ksqlDB corresponds exactly to the `payload eventTime` set by the producer (i.e., wall-clock time, when the event occurred)
. The `ROWTIME` value in ksqlDB corresponds exactly to the `log timestamp` printed by the producer's callback (i.e., ingestion time, when the record was written into the broker's log file)
