In the file explorer on the right, navigate to `tutorial-workspace/src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/`.Right click
on `KafkaProducerApplication.java`, and then click `Open to the Side`.

Let's look at some of the key points of this program. About 20 lines down:

[source, java]
.KafkaProducerApplication constructor
----

public class KafkaProducerApplication {

  private final Producer<String, String> producer;
  final String outTopic;

  public KafkaProducerApplication(final Producer<String, String> producer,  <1>
                                  final String topic) {                     <2>
    this.producer = producer;
    outTopic = topic;
  }

----

<1> Passing in the `Producer` instance as a constructor parameter.
<2> The topic to write records to


In this tutorial you'll inject the dependencies in the `KafkaProducerApplication.main()` method.
Having this thin wrapper class around a `Producer` is not required, but it does help with making our code easier to test.

(In practice you may want to use a dependency injection framework library, such as the  https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework[Spring Framework]).


Next let's take a look at the `KafkaProducerApplication.produce` method right below the constructor:
[source, java]
.KafkaProducerApplication.produce
----
public Future<RecordMetadata> produce(final String message) {
    final String[] parts = message.split("-");  <1>
    final String key, value;
    if (parts.length > 1) {
        key = parts[0];
        value = parts[1];
    } else {
        key = null;
        value = parts[0];
    }
    final ProducerRecord<String, String> producerRecord = new ProducerRecord<>(outTopic, key, value);  <2>
    return producer.send(producerRecord);                 <3>
}
----

<1> Process the String for sending message
<2> Create the `ProducerRecord`
<3> Send the record to the broker

The `KafkaProducerApplication.produce` method does some processing on a `String`, and then sends the https://kafka.apache.org/25/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html[`ProducerRecord`].  While this code is a trivial example, it's enough to show the example of using a `KafkaProducer`.
Notice that https://kafka.apache.org/34/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html#send-org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord-[`KafkaProducer.send`] returns a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Future.html[Future] with a type of https://kafka.apache.org/34/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/RecordMetadata.html[RecordMetadata].

The `KafkaProducer.send` method is asynchronous and returns as soon as the provided record is placed in the buffer of records to be sent to the broker. Once the broker acknowledges that the record has been appended to its log, the broker completes the produce request, which the application receives as `RecordMetadata`â€”information about the committed message.  This tutorial prints the `timestamp` and `offset` for each record sent using the `RecordMetadata` object.  Note that calling `Future.get()` for any record will block until the produce request completes.
