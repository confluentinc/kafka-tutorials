Now we'll run a console consumer that will read topics from the output topic to confirm your application published the expected records.

First, open a shell on the broker Docker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/gitpod/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Now run the console consumer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/gitpod/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output from the consumer can vary if you added any of your own records, but it should look something like this:

++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/gitpod/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
++++

Now close the consumer with a `CTRL+C` then the broker shell with a `CTRL+D`
