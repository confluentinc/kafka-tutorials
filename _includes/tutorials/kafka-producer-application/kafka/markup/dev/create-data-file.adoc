////
   Example content file for how to include a console produer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

////

Create the following file `input.txt` in the base directory of the tutorial.  The numbers before the `-` will be the key and the part after will be the value.
