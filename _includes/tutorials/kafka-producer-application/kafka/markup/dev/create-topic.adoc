In this step we're going to create a topic for use during this tutorial.


Open a new terminal window and then run this command to open a shell on the broker docker container
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Next, create the topic that the producer can write to

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/create-topic.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Keep this terminal window open for later use when you run a console consumer to verify your producer application.
