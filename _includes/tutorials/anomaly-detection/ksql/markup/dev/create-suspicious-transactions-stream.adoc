Using the table of suspicious names and stream of transactions, create a new stream of events containing transactions that were sent to an account name contained in the 'suspicious_names' table. We can do this by performing an `INNER JOIN`. In this case the `INNER JOIN` will couple events in the transaction stream where the "recipient" is the same as "company_name" in the suspicious_names table. The stream created below will continuously be populated by the coupled events created by the query.

[NOTE]
.Stream-Table Joins
====
*Things to note:* +
- ksqlDB only supports inner and left joins between a stream and a table. See link:https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/join-a-stream-to-a-table/ksql.html[*Join a stream and a table together*] for a `LEFT JOIN` example. +
- It is important for the table data to be loaded _before_ the stream event is received. `INNER JOIN` does not result in any output if the table-side does not already contain a value for the key, even if the table-side is later populated. +
- See more detailed link:https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/joins/join-streams-and-tables/#stream-table-joins[*ksqlDB `JOIN` documentation*].
