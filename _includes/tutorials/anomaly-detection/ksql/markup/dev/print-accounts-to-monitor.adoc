The ksqlDB table, and the underlying Kafka topic backing this table, contain a list of accounts against which more than three suspicious transactions have taken place in a 24-hour window.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/anomaly-detection/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-accounts-to-monitor.sql %}</code></pre>

The output should look like the following:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/anomaly-detection/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-accounts-to-monitor.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Note that if you were to alter the `LIMIT` of results to something greater than 1, you would not see any other accounts flagged even though Victor von Frankenstein had a transaction that was flagged as suspicious. If you decided to rerun the query with a new limit, use `Ctrl-D` to terminate the query. +


Events within the Kafka topic `accounts_to_monitor` can be used to drive monitoring and alerting applications that could take action such as placing a hold on the account, notifying the card holder, etc. +

Type 'exit' and hit enter to shutdown the ksqlDB CLI.
