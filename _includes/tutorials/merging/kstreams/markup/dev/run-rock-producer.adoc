To produce the input events to their respective topics, you'll want two terminals running. To send the rock songs to their topic, open up a terminal and run the following:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/merging/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer-rock.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input. Type in one line at a time and press enter to send it. Each line represents an event. To send all of the events below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/merging/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/rock-input-events.json %}</code></pre>
