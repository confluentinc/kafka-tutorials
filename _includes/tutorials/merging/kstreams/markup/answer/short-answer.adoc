The input streams are combined using the `merge` function, which creates a new stream that represents all of the events of its inputs.
The merged stream is forwarded to a combined topic via the `to` method, which accepts the topic as a parameter.

```
KStream<String, SongEvent> rockSongs = builder.stream(rockTopic);
KStream<String, SongEvent> classicalSongs = builder.stream(classicalTopic);
KStream<String, SongEvent> allSongs = rockSongs.merge(classicalSongs);

allSongs.to(allGenresTopic);
```
