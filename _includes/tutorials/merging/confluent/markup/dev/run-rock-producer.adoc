To produce the input events to their respective topics, you'll want two terminals running. To send the rock songs to their topic, open up a terminal and run the following:

```plaintext
confluent kafka topic produce rock-song-events \
      --value-format avro \
      --schema src/main/avro/song_event.avsc
```
