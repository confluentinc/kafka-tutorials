Leaving your original terminals running, open another to consume the events that have been merged:

```plaintext
confluent kafka topic consume all-song-events \
      --from-beginning \
      --value-format avro
```

After the consumer starts, you should see the following messages. The order might vary depending on the timing of which the input events are sent to each topic and processed by the app. Kafka Streams will coalesce the respective input topics together in an indeterminate manner. To continue studying the example, send more events through the input terminal prompt. Otherwise, you can `Control-C` to exit the process.
