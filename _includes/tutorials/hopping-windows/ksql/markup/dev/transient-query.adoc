Note that we called the query that detects the temperature drop as `TRIGGERED_ALERTS` and we modeled as a table, since we are performing some aggregations in the query. But just like the temperature readings, alerts can happen continuously â€“ therefore we transform the table back to a stream so we can have multiple alerts throughout time. Finally, also note that we rekeyed the stream to use the `ID` field as key.
