Now here comes the fun part. We need to create a query capable of detecting when the temperature drops below 45F for a period of 10 minutes. However, since our sensor emits readings every 5 minutes, we need to come up with a way to detect this even if the drop goes beyond the interval of 10 minutes. Hence why we are using hopping windows for this scenario. Hopping windows are possibly-overlapping, thus if the temperature dropped for 10 minutes but the drop was kept up to 5 minutes beyond an given window -- the query will be able to detect that as well.

Along with the implementation of a hopping window, we will based off our logic in the average temperature within the detected period, and we will show this period through two different fields called `START_PERIOD` and `END_PERIOD`. This may come in handy if your alert system needs to have the information of when the temperature drop happened, besides of course doing the alerting.

This should query should produce the following output:
