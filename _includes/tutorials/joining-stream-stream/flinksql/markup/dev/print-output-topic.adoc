To check that it's working, print out the contents of the output stream using the following query:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/joining-stream-stream/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/joining-stream-stream/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

As you can see, the output sits in a plain Kafka topic and therefore, any application that is able to consume data from it will be able to have access to this data.

Type 'exit' and hit enter to exit the ksqlDB CLI.
