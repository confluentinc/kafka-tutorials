Since the output of our transient query looks right, the next step is to make the query persistent. This looks exactly like the transient query, except we first create a new table and then execute an `INSERT INTO` statement to populate the table. The `INSERT INTO` statement returns to the CLI prompt right away, having created a persistent stream processing program running in the Flink cluster, continuously processing input records and updating the resulting `shipped_orders` table.

Now go ahead and tun the following two commands in your Flink SQL session:
