   Example content file for how to include a console producer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

////
Back in your producer/consumer terminal, start the console-producer again.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Then copy-paste the following records to send.  You'll use data resulting in different keys this time.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/named-input.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

After you've sent the records, you can shut down the console-producer with `Ctrl-C`.
