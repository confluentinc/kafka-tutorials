Now let's add a new operator (`filter()`) to the named topology:


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="java">
  KStream&lt;Long, Example&gt; inputStream = builder.stream(inputTopic, Consumed.with(longSerde, exampleSerde))
                                                  .selectKey((k, v) -> Long.parseLong(v.getName().substring(0, 1)))
                                                  .filter((k, v) -> k != 1L);
</code></pre>
+++++

But this time, adding a new processor won't change the name of the stateful parts of your application, as you've explicity named them in the previous step.

In the terminal running the streams application, do a `CTRL+C`, then restart the streams application with this command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/render-run-dev-app-names-with-filter.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++
