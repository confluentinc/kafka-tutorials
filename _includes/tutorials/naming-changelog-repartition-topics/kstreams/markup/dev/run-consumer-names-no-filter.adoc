  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Now let's start up the console consumer again:


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

For this run you should see all six records plus three new records:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-names-no-filter.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Since you used data resulting in new keys, `2-1, 2-2, 2-3` looks correct.

You can close this consumer for now with `Ctrl-C`.
