  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Stop the console-producer with `Ctrl-C`, and start the console-consumer.  Take note you're running the consumer with the `--from-beginning` option so you'll get all messages sent to the `output` topic.


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

From your first run you should see the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Note that even though this is the output of an aggregation operation, this tutorial configured the streams application to use `StreamsConfig.CACHE_MAX_BYTES_BUFFERING_CONFIG = 0`, so you'll see _**every**_ update from the `count()` operation.

Since the streams application takes the first character to use as the key, the output of `1-1`, `1-2`, and `1-3` (key-count) is expected.

You can close this consumer for now with `Ctrl-C`.
