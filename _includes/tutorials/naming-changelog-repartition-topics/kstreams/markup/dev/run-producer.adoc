   Example content file for how to include a console producer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

////
Open a new terminal and start the console-producer

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Then copy-paste the following records to send.  The data is formatted this way because the Kafka Streams application will create a key from the first character.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/naming-changelog-repartition-topics/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

After you've sent the records, you can shut down the console-producer with a `Ctrl-C`.
