With our test data in place, let's figure out how many ratings were given to each movie in tumbling (i.e., consecutive and non-overlapping) 6-hour intervals (and also what the average rating is for each window).
To do that, we issue the following transient query to aggregate the ratings, grouped by the movie’s title. This query uses
a windowing table-valued function (TVF) to compute the ratings count and average rating for 6-hour time windows. It also captures the window start and end times.

This query will continue to return results until you quit by entering `Q`.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/tumbling-windows/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query-ratings-by-6hr-window.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/tumbling-windows/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-ratings-by-6hr-window.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Observe that the sum of all rating counts is 10, whereas there are 11 ratings in the `ratings` table. Why is this? First, remember that we defined a strictly ascending timestamps watermark strategy. Second, keep in mind that a windowed aggregation does not emit intermediate results but only a final result.
So, in this case, the rating with `rating_id` 10 and timestamp `2023-07-10 01:00:00` served to "close" the window ending at `2023-07-10 00:00:00.000` because its event time is later than the window end time.

Enter `Q` to return to the Flink SQL prompt.

Note that these results were materialized in memory and printed in a human-readable table representation because the default `sql-client.execution.result-mode` configuration value is `'table'`. You can view non-materialized streaming results as a changelog by running `SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'changelog';`
and rerunning the same query. The results will look like this:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/tumbling-windows/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-changelog-ratings-by-6hr-window.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Or, as a third option, you can see streaming results non-materialized and inline in the SQL client by running ``SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'tableau';`` and rerunning the query once more. In this case, the results will look very similar to `changelog` mode results. This is because tables sourced by the Kafka connector are _unbounded_ and can thus only be queried in `streaming` mode.
