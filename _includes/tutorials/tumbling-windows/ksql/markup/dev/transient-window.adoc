Let's figure out how many ratings were given to each movie in tumbling, 6-hour intervals. To do that, we issue the following transient push query to aggregate the ratings, grouped by the movie's name. This tells ksqlDB that you only want to sum up the ratings on a per-movie basis. It also captures the window start and end times. These functions describe the boundaries that represent each 6-hour interval. The following will block and continue to return results until its limit is reached or you tell it to stop.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/tumbling-windows/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-window.sql %}</code></pre>

This should yield the following output:
