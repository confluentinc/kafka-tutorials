Let's figure out how many ratings were given to each movie in 6 hour tumbling intervals. To do that, we issue the following transient query to aggregate the ratings grouped by the movie's name. This tells KSQL that you only want to sum up the ratings on a per movie basis. It also captures the window start and end times. These functions describe the boundaries that represent each 6 hour interval. The following will block and continue to return results until its limit is reached or you tell it to stop.

This should yield the following output:
