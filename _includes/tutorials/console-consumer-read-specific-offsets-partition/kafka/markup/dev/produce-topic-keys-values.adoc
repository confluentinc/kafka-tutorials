To get started, lets produce some records to your new topic.

Since you've created a topic with more than one partition, you'll send full key-value pairs so you'll be able to see how different keys end up on different partitions.
To send full key-value pairs you'll specify the `parse.key` and `key.separator` options to the console producer command.

Let's run the following command in the broker container shell from the previous step to start a new console producer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer-keys.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


Then enter these records either one at time or copy-paste all of them into the terminal and hit enter:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-step-one.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

After you've sent the records, you can close the producer with a `CTRL+C` command, but keep the broker container shell open as you'll still need it for the next few steps.
