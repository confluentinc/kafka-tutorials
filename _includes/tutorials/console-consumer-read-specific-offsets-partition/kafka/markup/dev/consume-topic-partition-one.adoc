In the previous step, you consumed records from the first partition of your topic.  In this step you'll consume the rest of your records from the second partition `1`.

If you haven't done so already, close the previous console consumer with a `Ctrl-C`.

Then start a new console consumer to read only records from the second partition:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-keys-partition-one.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After a few seconds you should see something like this

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-step-two.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

As you'd expect, the remaining 9 records are on the second partition.

Go ahead and shut down the current consumer with a `Ctrl-C`
