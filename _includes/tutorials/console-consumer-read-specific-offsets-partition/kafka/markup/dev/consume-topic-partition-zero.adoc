Next let's open up a console consumer to read records sent to the topic in the previous step, but you'll only read from the first partition. Kafka partitions
are zero based so your two partitions are numbered `0`, and `1` respectively.

Using the broker container shell, lets start a console consumer to read only records from the first partition, `0`

After a few seconds you should see something like this

You'll notice you sent 12 records, but only 3 went to the first partition.  The reason for this is the way Kafka calculates the partition assignment for a given record.  Kafka calculates the partition by taking the hash of the key modulo the number of partitions.  So, even though you have 2 partitions, depending on what the key hash value is, you aren't guaranteed an even distribution of records across partitions.

Go ahead and shut down the current consumer with a `CTRL+C`
