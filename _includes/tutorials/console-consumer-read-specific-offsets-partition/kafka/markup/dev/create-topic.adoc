Your first step is to create a topic to produce to and consume from.  This time you'll add more than one partition so you can see how the keys end up on different partitions.

Your first step is to open a shell on the broker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Then use the following command to create the topic:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/create-topic.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Keep the container shell you just started open, as you'll use it in the next step.
