So far you've learned how to consume records from a specific partition. When you specify the partition, you can optionally specify the offest to start conuming from.  Specifying a specific offset can be helpful when debugging an issue, in that you can skip consuming records that you know aren't a potential problem.

If you haven't done so already, close the previous console consumer with a `CTRL+C`.

From the previous step you know there are 9 records in the second partition.  In this step you'll only consume records starting from offset 6, so you should only see the last 3 records on the screen. The changes in this command include removing the `--from-begining` propery and adding an `--offset` flag


Here's the command to read records from the second partition starting at offset 6:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-keys-partition-offset.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After a few seconds you should see something like this

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-step-three.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

So you can see here, you've consumed records starting from offset 6 to the end, which includes record with offsets of `6, 7, and 8` the last three records.

Go ahead and shut down the current consumer with a `CTRL+C`
