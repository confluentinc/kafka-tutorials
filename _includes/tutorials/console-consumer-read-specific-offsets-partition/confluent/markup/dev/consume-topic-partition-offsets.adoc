So far you've learned how to consume records from a specific partition. When you specify the partition, you can optionally specify the offset to start consuming from.  Specifying a specific offset can be helpful when debugging an issue, in that you can skip consuming records that you know aren't a potential problem.

If you haven't done so already, close the previous console consumer with `Ctrl-C`.

From the previous step you know there are 6 records in the second partition.  In this step you'll only consume records starting from offset 3, so you should only see the last 3 records on the screen. The changes in this command include removing the `--from-beginning` property and adding an `--offset` flag


Here's the command to read records from the second partition starting at offset 6:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-keys-partition-offset.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After a few seconds you should see something like this

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-read-specific-offsets-partition/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-step-three.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

As you can see, you've consumed records starting from offset `3` to the end of the log.

Go ahead and shut down the current consumer with `Ctrl-C`.
