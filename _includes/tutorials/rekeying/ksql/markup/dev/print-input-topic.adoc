Now that you have a stream, let's examine what key the Kafka messages have using the `PRINT` command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/rekeying/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-input-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield roughly the following output. `PRINT` pulls from all partitions of a topic. The order will be different depending on how the records were actually inserted:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/rekeying/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print-input.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Note that the key is `null` for every message. This means that ratings data for the same movie could be spread across multiple partitions. This is generally not good for scalability when you care about having the same "kind" of data in a single partition.
