Now that we have a topic with data in from the source system and the keys appropriately set, we can declare a ksqlDB table over the topic.

We only need to specify the datatype of the table's key (`CITY_ID`) â€“ the rest of the schema is picked up automagically from the Schema Registry since we're using Avro to serialize the value part of the payload.
