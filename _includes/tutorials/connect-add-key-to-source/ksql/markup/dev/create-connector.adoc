From the ksqlDB prompt you can create the JDBC source connector. There are a couple of points to note: 

1. The `transforms` stanza, which is responsible for setting the key to the value of the `city_id` field. They run in the order defined by `transforms`:
    * - `copyFieldToKey` sets the key to a struct containing the `city_id` field from the value.
    * - `extractKeyFromStruct` sets the key to just the `city_id` field of the struct set by the previous step.
    * - `removeKeyFromValue` removes the `city_id` from the message value, as it's now stored in the message key.
2. Since the key is an integer we override the default serialization and instead use the `IntegerConverter` for the key field
