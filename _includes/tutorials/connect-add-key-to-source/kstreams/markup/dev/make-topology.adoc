Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/connect/jdbc/specificavro/StreamsIngest.java`. Let's take a close look at the `buildTopology()` method, which uses the Kafka Streams DSL.

The first thing the method does is build a stream from the input topic.
It uses the `SpecificAvroSerde<>` to create a `KStream` called `citiesNoKey` that has no message key and a message value of type `City`.

Next, using the `map` method, it extracts a field in the message value that corresponds to the city ID, and assigns it as the message key.
It results in a `KStream` called `citiesKeyed` that has a message key of type `Long` and a message value of type `City`.

Finally this is written to the output topic using the `to` method.
