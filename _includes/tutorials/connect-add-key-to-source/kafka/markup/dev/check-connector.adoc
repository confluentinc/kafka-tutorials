Check that the connector is running:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/connect-add-key-to-source/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/check-connector.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see that the state is `RUNNING` for both `connector` and `tasks` elements

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/connect-add-key-to-source/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/check-connector_expected.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

If you get the message `{"error_code":404,"message":"No status found for connector jdbc_source_postgres_01"}` then check that the step above in which you created the connector actually succeeded.
