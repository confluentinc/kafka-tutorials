  This content file is used to describe how to add test code you developed in this tutorial.  You'll need to update the
  text to suit your test code.


////

Testing a Kafka streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

////
             You'll want to update the name of the test method from "exampleTest" to something more meaningful for your tutorial
////

There is only one method in `KafkaStreamsKTableTTLExampleTest` annotated with `@Test`, and that is `shouldTriggerStreamTableJoinFromTable()`. This method actually runs our Streams topology using the `TopologyTestDriver` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.


This test is fairly vanilla, but there is one section we should look into a little more

[source, java]
----
      tableTopic.pipeInput("alice", "a", 5);  <1>
      tableTopic.pipeInput("bobby", "b", 10);
      

      inputTopic.pipeInput("alice", "11", 10); <2>
      inputTopic.pipeInput("bobby", "21", 15);
      inputTopic.pipeInput("alice", "12", 30);
      

      tableTopic.pipeInput("freddy", "f", 65000);  <3> // punctuate gets called now

      inputTopic.pipeInput("alice", "13", 70006);  <4>
      inputTopic.pipeInput("bobby", "22", 70016);

 
      final List<KeyValue<String, String>> actualResults = outputTopic.readKeyValuesToList();

      assertThat(actualResults.size(), is(5));  <5>
      
      assertThat(actualResults.get(0).key, is("alice"));
      assertThat(actualResults.get(0).value, is("11 a"));
      
      assertThat(actualResults.get(1).key, is("bobby"));
      assertThat(actualResults.get(1).value, is("21 b"));

      assertThat(actualResults.get(2).key, is("alice"));
      assertThat(actualResults.get(2).value, is("12 a"));
      
      assertThat(actualResults.get(3).key, is("alice"));
      assertThat(actualResults.get(3).value, is("13")); // join didn't match on right side
      
      
      assertThat(actualResults.get(4).key, is("bobby"));
      assertThat(actualResults.get(4).value, is("22"));

----

<1> Piping some data into the KTable initially
<2> Pipe some data into the KStream to join
<3> Move the time forward by publishing something into the KTable with a timestamp greater than the TTL
<4> Pipe some more KStream data to fail to find a match
<5> Check each join to see where it matched and where it didn't match (due to the TTLed KTable records)


Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaStreamsKTableTTLExampleTest.java`.
