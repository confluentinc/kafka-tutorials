In order to build the project, first https://gradle.org/install/[install Gradle] 7.5 or later if you don't already have it.
Create the following Gradle build file, named `build.gradle` for the project. Note the `parallel-consumer-core` dependency,
which is available in Maven Central. This artifact includes the Confluent Parallel Consumer's core API.
There are also separate modules for using the Confluent Parallel Consumer with reactive API frameworks like Vert.x (`parallel-consumer-vertx`)
and Reactor (`parallel-consumer-reactor`). These modules are out of scope for this introductory tutorial.
