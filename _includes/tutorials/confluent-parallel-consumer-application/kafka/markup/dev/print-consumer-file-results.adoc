Your Confluent Parallel Consumer application should have consumed all the records sent and written them out to a file.

In a new terminal, run this command to print the results to the console:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/confluent-parallel-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-consumer-file-results.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see something like this:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/confluent-parallel-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Note that because we configured the Confluent Parallel Consumer to use `KEY` ordering, `Go to Current` appears before `Go to Kafka Summit`
because these values have the same `event-promo` key. Similarly, `All streams lead to Kafka` appears before `Consume gently down the stream`
because these values have the same `fun-line` key.

At this point you can stop the Confluent Parallel Consumer application with `Ctrl-C` in the terminal window where it's running.
