Now that you have an uberjar containing `ParallelConsumerPerfTest`, you can launch it locally.
This will run until the expected 10,000 records have been consumed. Ensure that the `seq` command that you ran previously to
produce 10,000 records has completed before running this so that we can accurately test consumption throughput.

As you kick this off, bear in mind the latency that you recorded when you ran `MultithreadedKafkaConsumerPerfTest` (40.46 seconds in the run performed for the tutorial).

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/confluent-parallel-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/perftest/run-parallel-consumer-perftest.sh %}</code></pre>

While the performance test runs, take a few sips of the beverage... actually never mind. It's done:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">[main] INFO io.confluent.developer.ParallelConsumerPerfTest - Time to consume 10000 records: 1.78 seconds</code></pre>
+++++

Your latency will surely be different from the `1.78 seconds` shown here. But, assuming you are running the test on reasonable hardware and you aren't running any
extremely noisy neighbors on your machine, it should be just a few seconds.
