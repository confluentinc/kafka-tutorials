Our tutorial computes the highest grossing and lowest grossing films per year in our data set. To keep things simple, we're going to create a source Kafka topic and KSQL stream with annual sales data in it. In a real-world data pipeline, this would probably be the output of another KSQL query that takes a stream of individual sales events and aggregates them into annual totals, but we'll save ourselves that trouble and just create the annual sales data directly.

This line of KSQL DDL creates a stream and its underlying Kafka topic to represent the annual sales totals. 
Note that we are defining the schema for the stream, which includes three fields: `title`, `release_year`, and `total_sales`. We are also specifying that the underlying Kafka topic—which KSQL will auto-create—be called `movie-ticket-sales` and have just one partition, and that its messages will be in Avro format.
