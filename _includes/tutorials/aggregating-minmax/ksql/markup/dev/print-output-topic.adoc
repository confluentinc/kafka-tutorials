Seeing is believing, so let's directly inspect that output topic using the `print` ksqlDB CLI command. We could also `SELECT * FROM MOVIE_FIGURES_BY_YEAR`, but here we opt for a more direct approach.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-minmax/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-minmax/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print-output-topic.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that ksqlDB is storing the `RELEASE_YEAR` in the key of the Kafka message. It does this because `RELEASE_YEAR` is the primary key of the `MOVIE_FIGURES_BY_YEAR` table.
If needed, a copy of `RELEASE_YEAR` can also be stored in the value by adding `AsValue(RELEASE_YEAR)` in the projection.
