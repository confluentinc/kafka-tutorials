Since the output looks right, the next step is to make the query persistent. This looks exactly like the transient query, except we have added a `CREATE TABLE AS` statement to the beginning of it. This statement returns to the CLI prompt right away, having created a persistent stream processing program running in the KSQL engine, continuously processing input records and updating the resulting `MOVIE_FIGURES_BY_YEAR` table. Moreover, we don't see the results of the query displayed in the CLI, because they are updating the newly-created table itself. That table is available to other KSQL queries for further processing, and by default all its records are produced to a topic having the same name (`MOVIE_FIGURES_BY_YEAR`).
