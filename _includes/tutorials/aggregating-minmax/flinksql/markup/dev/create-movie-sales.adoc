Our tutorial computes the highest grossing and lowest grossing films per year in our data set. To keep things simple, we're going to create a table backed by a Kafka topic with annual sales data in it. In a real-world data pipeline, this would probably be the output of another table that takes a stream of individual sales events and aggregates them into annual totals, but we'll save ourselves that trouble and just create the annual sales data directly.

This line of Flink SQL DDL creates a table and its underlying Kafka topic to represent the annual sales totals.
Note that we are defining the schema for the table, which includes four fields: `id`, `title`, `release_year`, and `total_sales`. We are also specifying that the underlying Kafka topic—which Flink SQL will auto-create—be called `movie-sales` and have just one partition (the default `num.partitions` configured in the broker), and that its messages will be in Avro format.
