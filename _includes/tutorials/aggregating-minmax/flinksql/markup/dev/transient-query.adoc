With our test data in place, let's try a query to compute the min and max. A `SELECT` statement in Flink SQL is called a _continuous query_ because it will continue to run and produce results dynamically. This query is _transient_, meaning that after we stop it, it is gone and will not keep processing the input stream. Further, the results aren't persisted anywhere. We'll create a _persistent_ query, the contrast to a transient push query, a few steps from now.

If you're familiar with SQL, the text of the query itself is fairly self-explanatory. We are calculating the highest and lowest grossing movie figures by year using `MIN` and `MAX` aggregations on the `total_sales` column. This query will keep running, continuing to return results until you use `Ctrl-C`.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-minmax/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-minmax/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Enter `Q` to return to the Flink SQL prompt.

Note that these results were materialized in memory and printed in a human-readable table representation because the default `sql-client.execution.result-mode` configuration value is `'table'`. You can view non-materialized streaming results as a changelog by running `SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'changelog';`
and rerunning the same query. The results will look like this:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-minmax/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-changelog.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Or, as a third option, you can see streaming results non-materialized and inline in the SQL client by running ``SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'tableau';`` and rerunning the query once more. In this case, the results will look very similar to `changelog` mode results. This is because tables sourced by the Kafka connector are _unbounded_ and can thus only be queried in `streaming` mode.
