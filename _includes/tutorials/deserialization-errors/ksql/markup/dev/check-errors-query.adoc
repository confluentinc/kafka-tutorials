Now here comes the fun part. We know that at least one of the records produced had an error, because we specified the field `ENABLED` as a string instead of a boolean. This should yield one deserialization error because we can't write a string into a boolean.
Therefore, this one error needs to show up somewhere.
With the https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/processing-log.html[KSQL Processing Log] feature enabled, you can query a stream called `KSQL_PROCESSING_LOG` to check for deserialization errors.

The query below is extracting some of the data available in the processing log.
As we configured the processing log to include the payload of the message, we can also use the `encode` method to convert the record from `base64` encoded into a human readable `utf8` encoding:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/check-errors-query.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice we needed to quote the `topic` field in the `WHERE` clause, as its a reserved word.

While the `ERRORMESSAGE` is a little cryptic in this instances, the `CAUSE` and `MSG` columns would be enough to diagnose the issue here.

This query should produce the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-check-errors-query.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
