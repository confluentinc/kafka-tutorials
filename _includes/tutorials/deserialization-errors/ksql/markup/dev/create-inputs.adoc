To start off the implementation of this scenario, you need to create a stream that represent sensors.
This stream will contain a timestamp field called `TIMESTAMP` to indicate when the sensor was enabled.
Each sensor will also have a field called `ENABLED` to indicate the status of the sensor.
While this stream acts upon data stored in a topic called `SENSORS_RAW`, we will create derived stream called `SENSORS` to actually handle the sensors.
This stream simply copies the data from the previous stream, ensuring that the `ID` field is used as the key.
