In order to implement a stream that will contain any deserialization errors that occurs in KSQL, we will enable the https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/reference/processing-log/[KSQL Processing Log] feature.
This feature allows us to capture any errors from KSQL and send to a topic that we will designate.
The first step to enable this feature is to create a custom Log4J configuration file that contains an appender capable of sending events with the errors to a Kafka topic.
Create a file named `log4j.properties` within the `log4j` folder with the content below.

Note that we declared an appender with the `org.apache.kafka.log4jappender.KafkaLog4jAppender` implementation.
This appender is able to produce records to a Kafka topic containing any event from the log.
The Kafka cluster and topic being used are specified via the properties 'BrokerList' and 'Topic', respectively.
Also note that the appender has been configured to send events using the JSON format, in the property 'layout'.
