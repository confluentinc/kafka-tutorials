We know that we produced three records to the stream but only two of them were actually correct.
In order to check if these two records were properly written into the stream, run the query below:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output should look similar to:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

For testing purposes, you can omit the limit clause to check if indeed there is only two records in the stream.
Do it if you feel the urge to double-check this.
