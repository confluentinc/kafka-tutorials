We purposely selected only some fields to prove the point about showing deserialization errors with the `KSQL_PROCESSING_LOG` stream, but each event produced to this stream carries much more useful data.
Print the contents of its underlying topic to see some more.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-topic.sql %}</code></pre>

The output should look similar to:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/outputs/print-topic/output-0.log %}</code></pre>

Note the presence of a field called `recordB64`.
This field contains the record that caused the deserialization error, in Base64 format.
If you decode this data, then you will have access to the record that caused the issue.
