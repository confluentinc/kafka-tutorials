Next, create the following `docker-compose.yml` file to obtain Confluent Platform:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="dockerfile">{% include_raw tutorials/deserialization-errors/ksql/code/docker-compose.yml %}</code></pre>
+++++

Note that there is some special configuration for the container `ksql-server`.
We have enabled the support for the https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/reference/processing-log/[KSQL Processing Log] feature by specifying that we want to have both the topic and the stream that will hold deserialization errors automatically.
We also specified that the topic name should be `ksql_processing_log` and that we want that each event produced to the topic also include a copy of the row that caused the deserialization error.
This is very important if you want to have all the tools needed to figure out what went wrong.
