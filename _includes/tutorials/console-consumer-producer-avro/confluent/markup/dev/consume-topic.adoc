Next, let's open up a consumer to read records from the new topic.

From the same terminal you used to create the topic above, run the following command to start a console consumer with the Confluent CLI:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/harness-console-consumer-keys.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The consumer will start up and block waiting for records, you won't see any output until after the next step.
