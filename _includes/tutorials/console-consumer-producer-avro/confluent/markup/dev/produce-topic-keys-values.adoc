Kafka works with key-value pairs, but so far you've only sent records with values only.  Well to be fair you've sent key-value pairs, but the keys are `null`.
Sometimes you'll need to send a valid key in addition to the value from the command line.

To enable sending full key-value pairs from the command line you add two properties to your Confluent CLI, `parse-key` and `delimiter`

Let's try to send some full key-value records now.  If your previous producer is still running close it with a `Ctrl-C` and run the following command to start a new console producer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer-keys.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


Then enter these records either one at time or copy-paste all of them into the terminal and hit enter:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-step-three.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++
