Next letâ€™s open up an Avro console consumer to read records sent to the topic you created in previous step.

From the same terminal you used to create the topic and schema above, run the following command to open a terminal on the broker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

From within the terminal on the schema-registry container, run this command to start an Avro console consumer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The consumer will start up and block waiting for records, you won't see any output until after the next step.
