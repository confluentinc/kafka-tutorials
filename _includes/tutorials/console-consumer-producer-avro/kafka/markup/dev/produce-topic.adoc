To produce your first Avro record into Kafka, open another terminal window and run the following command to open a second shell on the broker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

From inside the second terminal on the schema-registry container, run the following command to start a console producer with the schema you created previously:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The producer will start and wait for you to enter input. Each line represents one Avro record and to send it you’ll hit the enter key.

Try copying and pasting one line at a time, hit enter and go back to the Avro console consumer window and look for the output.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-avro/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-step-one.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Once you’ve sent all the records you should see the same output in your Avro console consumer window.
After you’ve confirmed receiving all records go ahead and close the consumer by entering `CTRL+C`.
