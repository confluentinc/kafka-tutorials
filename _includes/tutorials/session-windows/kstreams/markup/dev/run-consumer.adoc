  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Now that your Kafka Streams application is running, open a new terminal window, change directories (`cd`) into the `session-windows` directory and start a console-consumer to confirm the output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/session-windows/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your results should look someting like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
51.56.119.117 : Session info started: 1:13:45 PM EST ended: 1:14:23 PM EST with count 4
53.170.33.192 : Session info started: 1:13:55 PM EST ended: 1:14:43 PM EST with count 4

Processed a total of 4 messages
</code></pre>
++++


Go ahead and shut down your streams application now with a `CNTR+C` command.
