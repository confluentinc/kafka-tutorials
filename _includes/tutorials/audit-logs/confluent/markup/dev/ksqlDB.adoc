The stream processing application filters for events involving operations on `topics`, but you can review the link:https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/audit-logs/audit-logs-concepts.html#audit-log-content[structure of Confluent audit logs] and extend this solution to filter for any link:https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/audit-logs/audit-logs-concepts.html#auditable-events[auditable event].
The first stream will set a schema for the Confluent Cloud audit log data, which will enable you to selectively pull out only the parts that you need to analyze. We'll discuss this more in the link:#explanation[Explanation] section.
