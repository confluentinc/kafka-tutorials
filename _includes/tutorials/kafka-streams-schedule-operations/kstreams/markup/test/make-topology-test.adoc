  This content file is used to describe how to add test code you developed in this tutorial.  You'll need to update the
  text to suit your test code.

Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaStreamsPunctuationTest.java`. Testing a Kafka streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

////
             You'll want to update the name of the test method from "exampleTest" to something more meaningful for your tutorial
////

There is only one method in `KafkaStreamsPunctuationTest` annotated with `@Test`, and that is `exampleTest()`. This method actually runs our Streams topology using the `TopologyTestDriver` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
