  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Now that your Kafka Streams application is running, start a console-consumer to confirm the output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your results should look someting like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
User_6 @Thu Aug 20 16:30:33 EDT 2020 : 1
User_9 @Thu Aug 20 16:30:35 EDT 2020 : 601
User_9 @Thu Aug 20 16:30:40 EDT 2020 : 2903
User_4 @Thu Aug 20 16:30:45 EDT 2020 : 5904
User_3 @Thu Aug 20 16:30:50 EDT 2020 : 13305
User_8 @Thu Aug 20 16:30:55 EDT 2020 : 28909
User_9 @Thu Aug 20 16:31:00 EDT 2020 : 18303
User_9 @Thu Aug 20 16:31:05 EDT 2020 : 24804
User_9 @Thu Aug 20 16:31:10 EDT 2020 : 32205
User_9 @Thu Aug 20 16:31:15 EDT 2020 : 58108
</code></pre>
++++


The timestamp after the user-id is there to help see the time when Kafka Streams executed the puntuation.  In practice you most likely wouldn't append a timestamp to your key.
