  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Before you start producing ratings, it's a good idea to set up the consumer on the output topic. This way, as soon as you produce data you can see the results as they are output.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You won't see any results until the next step.
