In this file you describe the Kafka streams topology, and should cover the main points of the tutorial.
The text assumes a method buildTopology exists and constructs the Kafka Streams application.  Feel free to modify the text below to suit your needs.

Before you create the Kafka Streams application file let's go over the key points of the application.  In this tutorial, instead of performing an operation on each key-value pair, you want to store the results in a state store and execute your buisiness logic at regular intervals.  In other words, you want to schedule an operation and Kafka Streams will run your code at regular intervals.  In this case you'll use the https://kafka.apache.org/26/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/ProcessorContext.html#schedule-java.time.Duration-org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.PunctuationType-org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.Punctuator-[ProcessorContext.schedule] method.

To use the `ProcessorContext` you need to build your Kafka Streams application using the https://kafka.apache.org/26/documentation/streams/developer-guide/processor-api.html[Processor API] or use one of the DSL methods that provide https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#applying-processors-and-transformers-processor-api-integration[Processor API integration].  In this tutorial you'll go for the latter option and use https://kafka.apache.org/26/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html#transform-org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.TransformerSupplier-org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.Named-java.lang.String...-[KStreams.transform]

NOTE: Since the `KStream.transform` method **_can potentially_** change the key, using this method flags the KStream instance as needing a repartition.  But the repartition _**only**_ happens if you perform a join or an aggregation after the transform.  I used transform in this tutorial as it makes for a better example because you can use the `ProcessorContext.forward` method.  Additionally, you're not doing any joins or aggregations, so there's **_no repartition required_**. But it's important to consider your requirements and in most cases use a `transformValues` instead.

Now let's take a look at some of the key points from the application.

For context your application consumes from a topic with information how long users have been logged into different applications.  Your goal is to emit the user with the longest login times across all applications every five seconds.  To do this you track the total login time per user in a state store.  Additionally, every twenty seconds you want reset the cumulative times to zero every twenty seconds.

NOTE: The following detailed sections are already included in the application file, we're just taking a detailed step through the code before you create it.

[source, java]
.Using the Transformer in the Kafka Streams application
----
final KStream<String, LoginTime> loginTimeStream = builder.stream(loginTimeInputTopic, Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), loginTimeSerde));
loginTimeStream.transform(getTransformerSupplier(loginTimeStore), Named.as("max-login-time-transformer"),loginTimeStor/e) //<1>
               .to(outputTopic, Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));


private TransformerSupplier<String, LoginTime, KeyValue<String, Long>> getTransformerSupplier(final String storeName) {
	    return () -> new Transformer<String, LoginTime, KeyValue<String, Long>>() { //<2>
	        private KeyValueStore<String, Long> store;
	        private ProcessorContext context;
            @Override
            public void init(ProcessorContext context) { //<3>
                   this.context = context;
                   store = (KeyValueStore<String, Long>) this.context.getStateStore(storeName);
                   this.context.schedule(Duration.ofSeconds(5), PunctuationType.STREAM_TIME, this::streamTimePunctuator); //<4>
                   this.context.schedule(Duration.ofSeconds(20), PunctuationType.WALL_CLOCK_TIME, this::wallClockTimePunctuator); //<5>
            }


@Override
public KeyValue<String, Long> transform(String key, LoginTime value) { //<6>
       Long currentVT = store.putIfAbsent(key, value.getLogintime());
       if (currentVT != null) {
           store.put(key, currentVT + value.getLogintime());
       }
       return null;
}

----

<1> Adding a transform operation to the KStream
<2> Using a lambda since the TransformerSupplier interface only has one method, get().  Calling `get()` should always return a new instance of a `Transformer`
<3> The `init` method used to configure the transformer.  It's in the init method you schedule any punctuations.  Kafka Streams calls the init method for all processors/transformers.
<4> Scheduling a punctation to occur based on `STREAM_TIME` every five seconds.  The third parameter is a method handle used for the `Punctuator` interface.
<5> Scheduling a punction to fire based on `WALL_CLOCK_TIME` every twenty seconds.  The third parameter is a method handle used for the `Punctuator` interface.
<6> The transform method.  All you are doing here is incrementing the total time a user is logged in and storing it in a state store.

From the above code section, you are adding a `transform` operation to the stream reading from the input topic. The key parts of this section are points four and five where you schedule the punctuations.  There are two schedule operations one using `STREAM_TIME` and another using `WALL_CLOCK_TIME`.  These two are from the https://kafka.apache.org/26/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/PunctuationType.html[PunctuationType enum].

The stream-time punctution fires based on timestamps on the incoming records, stream-time only advances as records arrive.  The wall-clock-time punctuation fires based on system time advanced at the polling interval and is independent of the rate incoming messages.  Read https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/concepts.html#time[how Kafka Streams supports notions of time] for more information.

Next let's talk discuss the scheduling in a little more detail.

When you schedule a punctuation, you provide three parameters:

1. How often the punctuation should execute defined as a type of `Duration`
2. The `PunctuationType` either stream-time or wall-clock tome
3. An instance of the https://kafka.apache.org/26/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/Punctuator.html[Punctuator interface].  Since the `Punctuator` interface has only one , `puncutate`, typically you'll use either a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html[lambda expression] or a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html[method reference].  In this case we've used a method reference.

Now let's take a look at these methods.

[source, java]
.Method references used for puntuations
----
 void wallClockTimePunctuator(Long timestamp){ <1>
                try (KeyValueIterator<String, Long> iterator = store.all()) {
                    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
                        KeyValue<String, Long> keyValue = iterator.next();
                        store.put(keyValue.key, 0L);
                    }
                }
                System.out.println("@" + new Date(timestamp) +" Reset all view-times to zero");
            }

void streamTimePunctuator(Long timestamp) { <2>
        Long maxValue = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        String maxValueKey = "";
        try (KeyValueIterator<String, Long> iterator = store.all()) {
            while (iterator.hasNext()) {
                KeyValue<String, Long> keyValue = iterator.next();
                if (keyValue.value > maxValue) {
                    maxValue = keyValue.value;
                    maxValueKey = keyValue.key;
                }
            }
        }
        context.forward(maxValueKey +" @" + new Date(timestamp), maxValue); <3>
    }

----

<1> The `wallClockTimePunctuator` resets the times for all users to zero every 20 seconds.
<2> The `streamTimePunctuator` calculates the user with the largest logged in time
<3> Forwarding the results, in this case to a topic

That wraps up our discussion for the finer points of the code for this tutorial.  Now create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaStreamsPunctuation.java`
