   Example content file for how to include a console produer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

Before you start your Kafka Streams application, we need to provide data for it. Fortunately this is as simple as using a HTTP `PUT` request, as you're going to use the `DatagenConnector`.


Now create the following Avro schema file `datagen-logintime.avsc` in the current working directory (`kafka-streams-schedule-operations`) for the tutorial:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="avro">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams/code/datagen-logintime.avsc %}</code></pre>
+++++

This schema file is pretty much idential to the one you created earlier.

The only difference is this schema contains instructions for data generation.  The https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-datagen[kafka-connect-datagen] connector uses the https://github.com/confluentinc/avro-random-generator[Avro Random Generator] to generate data.


Open an new terminal window and run this command to start the data generator:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/create-connector.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


You should see something like this on the console indicating the datagen connector sucessfuly started
