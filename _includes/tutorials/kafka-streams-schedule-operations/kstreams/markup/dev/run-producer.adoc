   Example content file for how to include a console produer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

////

In a new terminal, run:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input. Copy and paste one line at a time and press enter to send it. Note that these lines contain hard tabs between the key and the value, so retyping them without the tab will not work.

Each line represents input data for the Kafka Streams application.  To send all of the events below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-streams-schedule-operations/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/example-input.json %}</code></pre>
+++++
