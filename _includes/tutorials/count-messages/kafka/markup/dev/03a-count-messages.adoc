You can count the number of messages in a Kafka topic simply by consuming the entire topic and counting how many messages are read. 

To do this from the commandline you can use the https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[`kafkacat`] tool which can act as a consumer (and producer) and is built around the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)[Unix philosophy of pipelines]. This means that you can pipe the output (messages) from kafkacat into another tool to count the number of messages.

Let's take a close look at the commandline soup we've used here to count the messages. 

* `docker exec kafkacat` runs the following command with its arguments in the Docker container called `kafkacat`
* `\` is a line continuation character
** `kafkacat` runs kafkacat itself, passing in arguments as follows: 
*** `-b` the location of the cluster broker(s)
*** `-C` act as a consumer
*** `-t` read data from the `pageviews` topic
*** `-e` exit once at the end of the topic
*** `-q` run quietly
** `|` pipes the messages from kafkacat to the next command 
** `wc` reads the piped messages and writes the count to screen
*** `-l` specifies to count the number of lines in total (one message per line). Contrast this to `-c` which would return the number of bytes.
