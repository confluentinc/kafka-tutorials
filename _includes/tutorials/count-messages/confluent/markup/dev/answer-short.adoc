With the Confluent Cloud Metrics API, you could also sum up the values of the metric `io.confluent.kafka.server/received_records`, which is "The delta count of records received. Each sample is the number of records received since the previous data sample. The count is sampled every 60 seconds." See the https://api.telemetry.confluent.cloud/docs/descriptors/datasets/cloud[documentation] for details.
