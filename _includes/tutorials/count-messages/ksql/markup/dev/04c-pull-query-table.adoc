Often we will want to just query the current number of messages in a topic from the materialised view that we built in the ksqlDB table and exit. Compare this to the query above with `EMIT CHANGES` in which the query continues to run until we cancel it (or add a `LIMIT` clause).

As before we get the total number of messages, but instead of querying the stream directly—and performing the aggregation whilst we wait—we are querying the stateful aggregation that ksqlDB has built.

This type of query is known as a https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/concepts/queries/pull/[_pull query_] and can be used against ksqlDB tables with materialised state with certain conditions around the predicate used.
