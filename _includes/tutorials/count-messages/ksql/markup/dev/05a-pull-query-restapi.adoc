The neat thing about it is that you can use ksqlDB's https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/api/[REST API] (or https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-clients/java-client/[Java client]) to run pull queries from your own application to directly look up a value. Consider, instead of needing an external datastore into which to hold state for your application to query, you can actually do this directly from Kafka and ksqlDB itself. 

Exit the ksqlDB command prompt and run this from your shell directly:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/count-messages/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/05a-pull-query-restapi.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Now you get the count of messages in the Kafka topic, queried directly from the materialized view that's built and populated in ksqlDB.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/count-messages/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/05a-pull-query-restapi.out %}</code></pre>
