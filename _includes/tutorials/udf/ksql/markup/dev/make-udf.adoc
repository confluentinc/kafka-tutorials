Here we have created a new Class which defines two functions, both of which are annotated with `Udf`, indicating they are ksqlDB UDF function definitions.   Both functions take parameters of type `double` or `int` and produce a single result of type `double`, representing the calculated volume-weighted average price of the inputs.
