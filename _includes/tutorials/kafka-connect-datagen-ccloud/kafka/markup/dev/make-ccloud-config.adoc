This tutorial runs on Confluent Cloud and assumes you already completed the link:https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/cloud-quickstart/index.html[Confluent Cloud Quick Start], which walks through the required steps to obtain:

- A Confluent Cloud user account: email address and password that logs you into the Confluent Cloud UI
- Access to a Confluent Cloud cluster: identification of the broker's endpoint via the Confluent Cloud UI or the link:https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/cli/index.html[Confluent Cloud CLI] command `ccloud kafka cluster describe` (if you don't have a cluster yet, follow the quick start above to create one)
- Credentials to the cluster: a valid API key and secret for the user or service account that can produce to the cluster
