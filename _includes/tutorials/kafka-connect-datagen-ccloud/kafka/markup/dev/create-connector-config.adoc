You can provision the connector through the Confluent Cloud UI, but this tutorial uses the link:https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/cli/index.html[Confluent Cloud CLI] which you must have installed locally.

First, create a file called `datagen-source-config.json` with the connector configuration for the Kafka Connect Datagen source connector for Confluent Cloud.
There are a few parameters for this connector, which you can read about in the link:https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/connectors/cc-datagen-source.html[documentation].
This configuration produces data with a schema specification called `PAGEVIEWS` that is defined in https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-datagen/blob/master/src/main/resources/pageviews_schema.avro.
