Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/RunningAverage.java`.
Let's take a close look at the `buildTopology()` method, which uses the Kafka Streams DSL.

Please note the code snippet around line 134.
To calculate the running average, we need to capture the sum of ratings and counts as part of the same aggregating operation.


[source,java]
.Compute count and sum in a single aggregation step and emit `<count,sum>` tuple as aggregation result values.
----
final KTable<Long, CountAndSum> ratingCountAndSum =
        ratingsById.aggregate(() -> new CountAndSum(0L, 0.0),
                              (key, value, aggregate) -> {
                                aggregate.setCount(aggregate.getCount() + 1);
                                aggregate.setSum(aggregate.getSum() + value);
                                return aggregate;
                              },
                              Materialized.with(Long(), countAndSumSerde));
----


[source,java]
.Compute average for each tuple.
----
final KTable<Long, Double> ratingAverage =
        ratingCountAndSum.mapValues(value -> value.getSum() / value.getCount(),
                                    Materialized.as("average-ratings"));

----

This pattern can also be applied to compute a windowed average or to compose other functions.
