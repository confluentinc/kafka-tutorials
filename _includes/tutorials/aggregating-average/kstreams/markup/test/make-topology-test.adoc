Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/RunningAverageTest.java`. 
Testing a Kafka streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

There is a `validateAverageRating()` method in `RunningAverageTest` annotated with `@Test`. 
This method actually runs our Streams topology using the `TopologyTestDriver` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
