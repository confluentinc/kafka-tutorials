  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Now that you have sent the login events, let's run a consumer to read the output from your streams application


+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/versioned-ktables/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


You should see something like this

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/versioned-ktables/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++


To prove that the topic backing the KTable does contain the invalid entries run another console consumer command to inspect the contents:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/versioned-ktables/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-verify-table.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


You should see something similar to this output.  Take note of the timestamps of the entries, they show our invalid entries arrived after the correct ones and taking into account the application populates the topics *_before starting_* the Kafka Streams application, you can see how the versioned `KTable` ensures a
semantically correct temporal join.
