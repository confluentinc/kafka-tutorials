Create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/LoginAggregatorTest.java`.

This tests the `Aggregator` the `Cogrouping` operation uses.  As I said previously, you can easily include an instance of the `Aggregator` in-line as a lambda in the original topology.  But by having it as a stand alone class, you can easily test the `Aggregator` in a unit test.
