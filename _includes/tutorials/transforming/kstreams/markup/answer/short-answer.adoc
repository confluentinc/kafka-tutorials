Use the `map()` method to take each input record and create a new stream with transformed records in it. The records are transformed via a custom function, in this case `convertRawMovie()`.

```
KStream<Long, Movie> movies = rawMovies.map((key, rawMovie) ->
                                                new KeyValue<>(rawMovie.getId(), convertRawMovie(rawMovie)));
```
