Create the following test file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/TransformStreamTest.java`. Testing a Kafka streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

There are two methods in `TransformStreamTest` annotated with `@Test`: `testMovieConverter()` and `testTransformStream()`. `testMovieConverter()` is a simple method that tests the string that is core to the transformation action of this Streams application. `testMovieConverter()` actually runs our Streams topology using the `TopologyTestDriver` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
