Next let's open up a console consumer to read records sent to the topic you created in the previous step.  From the same terminal you used to create the topic, run this command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-produer-basic/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The consumer will start up and block waiting for records, you won't see any output until after the next step.
