  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Now that your Kafka Streams application is running, open a new terminal window, cd into the `sliding-windows` directory and start a console-consumer to confirm the output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/sliding-windows/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your results should look someting like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
device-1 : 79.77
device-1 : 80.63
device-2 : 89.87
device-1 : 79.76
device-1 : 80.06
device-1 : 82.06
device-2 : 73.63
device-2 : 81.75
device-1 : 86.32
device-1 : 82.82
</code></pre>
++++


Go ahead and shut down your streams application now with a `CNTR+C` command.
