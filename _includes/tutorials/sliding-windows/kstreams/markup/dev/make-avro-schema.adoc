  This is an example file for adding an Avro schema to the tutorial.  You should have one of these make-TYPE-schema steps for
  each schema you are using in the tutorial, named "make-TYPE-schema.adoc".  For example if this was a file in a tutorial it
  would get named "make-movie.schema.adoc".  You will also need to make the corresponding Avro file in
  _includes/tutorials/sliding-windows/kstreams/code/src/main/avro.

  You'll need to update the wording and names of the avro files to fit your tutorial.

  If you aren't using Avro, delete this file from the folder.

Then create the following Avro schema file at `src/main/avro/temperature_reading.avsc` for our `TemperatureReading` object:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="avro">{% include_raw tutorials/sliding-windows/kstreams/code/src/main/avro/temperature_reading.avsc %}</code></pre>
+++++

You'll also need to create another schema `src/main/avro/temp_average.avsc` for the `TempAverage` object that Kafka Streams will use for holding the data needed to perform the aggregation.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="avro">{% include_raw tutorials/sliding-windows/kstreams/code/src/main/avro/temp_average.avsc %}</code></pre>
