Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/RegexReplace.java`.  This file contains the Java logic of your custom function.  Read through the code to familiarize yourself.  You will see that the code is checking for `null` values in each of the parameters.  We do this because, the custom function could be used with unpopulated data that will send a `null` to the `input` parameter.  As as extra sanity we check the `regex` and `replacement` parameters are not sent null.
