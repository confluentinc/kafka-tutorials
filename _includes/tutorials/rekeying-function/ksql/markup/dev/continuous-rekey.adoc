Now, using ksqlDB's appropriately-named `PARTITION BY` clause, we can apply the results of `REGEXREPLACE` as the key for each message and write the result to a new stream.

As we're not partitioning by an existing column, ksqlDB will add a new column to the `customers_by_area_code` stream based on the result of our function call.

We provide the name `AREA_CODE` for this new column in the projection.
