<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/rekeying-function/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/query-rekeyed-stream.sql %}</code></pre>

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/rekeying-function/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-query-rekeyed-stream.log %}</code></pre>
