You can create a Gradle build file to build your Java code into a jar file that is supplied to KSQL. Create the following Gradle build file, named `build.gradle` for the project:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="groovy">{% include_raw tutorials/rekeying-function/ksql/code/build.gradle %}</code></pre>
+++++

The `build.gradle` also contains a `copyJar` step to copy the jar file to the `extensions/` directory where it will be picked up by KSQL. This can be convenient when you are iterating on a function.  You've tested against your suite of unit tests and you are now ready to test against steams in KSQL.  With the jar in the correct place a restart of KSQL will load your updated jar.
