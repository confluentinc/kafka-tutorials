<pre class="snippet"><code class="dockerfile">{% include_raw tutorials/rekeying-function/ksql/code/docker-compose.yml %}</code></pre>

Note `docker-compose.yml` has configured the `ksql-server` container with `KSQL_KSQL_EXTENSION_DIR: "/etc/ksql/ext/"`, and maps the local `extensions` directory to `/etc/ksql/ext` in the container. KSQL is now configured to look in this location for your extensions such as custom functions.
