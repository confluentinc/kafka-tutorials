Next, let's open up a consumer to read records from the new topic. 

From the same terminal you used to create the topic above, run the following command to start a console consumer with the `ccloud` CLI:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/ccloud-produce-consume/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/harness-console-consumer-keys.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The ccloud CLI will prompt you for your Confluent Cloud Schema Registry API Key and Secret.  Enter the values noted from the newly provisioned `ccloud-stack` above.

Once the Schema Registry values are entered, the consumer will start up and block waiting for records, you won't see any output until after the next step.
