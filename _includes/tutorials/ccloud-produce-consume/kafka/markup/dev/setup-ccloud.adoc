We recommend you run this tutorial in a new Confluent Cloud environment so it doesn't interfere with your other work, and the easiest way to do this is to use the `ccloud-stack` utility.
The `ccloud-stack` utility provisions a new Confluent Cloud stack with a new environment, a new service account, a new Kafka cluster, and associated credentials. It also enables Schema Registry and credentials, wildcard ACLs for the service account, and a local configuration file with all the above connection information.
For more information on `ccloud-stack`, read the link:https://docs.confluent.io/current/tutorials/examples/ccloud/docs/ccloud-stack.html[documentation].


Get the open source library link:https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/blob/latest/utils/ccloud_library.sh[ccloud_library.sh] which has functions to interact with Confluent Cloud, including `ccloud-stack`.

Create your stack of Confluent Cloud resources by running the following command.
Set `CLUSTER_CLOUD` and `CLUSTER_REGION` as needed (defaults are shown below).

NOTE: To avoid unexpected charges, carefully evaluate the cost of resources before launching the script and ensure all resources are destroyed after you are done running the tutorial.

The `false` passed to the command indicates we do not want to create a ksqlDB application which we do not need for this tutorial.

After running the `ccloud::create_ccloud_stack` function, you should output similar to the following:
