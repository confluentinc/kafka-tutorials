View the local configuration file that was created after you provisioned a new `ccloud-stack`, where `*` in this case is the new service account id:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/ccloud-produce-consume/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/view-ccloud-config.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your output should resemble:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/ccloud-produce-consume/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/sample-stack.cfg %}</code></pre>
+++++
 
Note the credentials for the Schema Registry (`<SR API KEY>` and `<SR API SECRET>`), you will need them shortly.
