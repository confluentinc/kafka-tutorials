  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Start a console-consumer to confirm the output (no join happened in the final 3 lines so only the KStream side data should appear in those lines):

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/schedule-ktable-ttl-aggregate/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-2.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your results should look someting like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
key1 : Bunch of coconuts what a lovely
foo : baz bar
fun : post quarantine not quarantine
key1 : Bunch of coconuts
foo : baz
fun : post quarantine
</code></pre>
++++
