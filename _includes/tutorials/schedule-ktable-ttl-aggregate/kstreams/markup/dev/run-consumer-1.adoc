  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

////

Now that your Kafka Streams application is running, start a console-consumer to confirm the output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/schedule-ktable-ttl-aggregate/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-1.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your results should look someting like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
key1 : Bunch of coconuts what a lovely
foo : baz bar
fun : post quarantine not quarantine
</code></pre>
++++


The timestamp after the user-id is there to help see the time when Kafka Streams executed the punctuation.  In practice you most likely wouldn't append a timestamp to your key.
