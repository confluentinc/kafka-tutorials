In this file you describe the Kafka streams topology, and should cover the main points of the tutorial.
The text assumes a method buildTopology exists and constructs the Kafka Streams application.  Feel free to modify the text below to suit your needs.

Now you'll take a similar step and create the Avro schemas; this is done for comparison and is not strictly required.  As with Protobuf, you'll have two schemas for the domain objects and a third schema that will contain the references.  Avro has a distinct difference regarding the reference schema, and you'll see it as we go through this section.



To get started, create a directory for the Avro schemas:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="bash">{% include_raw tutorials/multiple-event-types/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/make-avro-dir.sh %}</code></pre>
++++

Then, create this schema file for the purchase domain object at `src/main/avro/purchase.avsc`

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/multiple-event-types/kafka/code/src/main/avro/purchase.avsc %}</code></pre>
+++++

Right away, you'll notice one difference is that you write Avro schemas in `JSON` while Protobuf more closely resembles a programming language.

In this tutorial we won't go into details about Avro.  For more information  you can read the https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/[Apache Avro documentation],  https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/gettingstartedjava.html[Getting Started (Java) guide], and the https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/spec.html[Avro Specification].


Next, create the schema for the pageview object at `src/main/avro/pageview.avsc`

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/multiple-event-types/kafka/code/src/main/avro/pageview.avsc %}</code></pre>
+++++

Now that you have the schemas in place for your two domain objects, you'll create a third schema that references the other two.

Go ahead and create the file `src/main/avro/all-events.avsc` now:
[source, json]
----
[
  "io.confluent.developer.avro.Purchase",
  "io.confluent.developer.avro.Pageview"
]
----

The `all-events.avsc` file contains an https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/spec.html#Unions[Avro Union].  The union type in Avro is analogous to the Protobuf `oneof` field in that it indicates that a field might have more than one datatype.

On the other hand, with Avro, a `union` can be a top-level element, so you don't have to create a wrapper or container class; the Avro schema itself is a union and it can represent either of the types listed in the union.  To be clear, you could create an Avro schema for a wrapper class and provide a `union` field within the schema, but we're not going to cover that approach in this tutorial.  The GitHub repo for the https://github.com/bbejeck/multiple-events-kafka-summit-europe-2021/blob/main/src/main/avro/customer_event.avsc[Multiple Events in Schema Registry Kafka Summit Europe 2021 presentation] contains an example of using an outer Avro class containing a union field.
