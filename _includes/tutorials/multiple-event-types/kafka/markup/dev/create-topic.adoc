In this step, weâ€™re going to create a topics needed for this tutorial.

Since you are going to produce records using Protobuf and Avro serialization, you'll need two topics.

But first, you're going to open a shell on the broker docker container.

Open a new terminal and window then run this command:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/multiple-event-types/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Now use the following commands to create the topics:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/multiple-event-types/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/create-topic.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Keep this terminal window open as you'll need to run a console-producer in a few steps.
