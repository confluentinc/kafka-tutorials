In this step, we’re going to create the topics needed for this tutorial.

Since you are going to produce records using Protobuf and Avro serialization, you'll need two topics.

Use the following commands to create the topics:

```plaintext
confluent kafka topic create avro-events
confluent kafka topic create proto-events
```
