To produce data into the original Kafka topic `topic1`, open another terminal window and run the following command to open a second shell on the broker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/change-topic-partitions-replicas/ksql/code/test/produce-data-input.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The producer will start and wait for you to enter input.
Copy and paste the contents of `test/input.txt`.
Close the producer by entering CTRL+C.
