In a new terminal, run:

```plaintext
confluent kafka topic produce movies --value-format avro --schema src/main/avro/movie.avsc

In this case the table data originates from a Kafka topic that was populated by a console producer using `ccloud` CLI but this doesn't always have to be the case. You can use Kafka Connect to stream data from a source system (such as a database) into a Kafka topic, which could then be the foundation for a lookup table.
