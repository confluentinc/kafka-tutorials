Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/JoinStreamToTable.java`. Let's take a close look at the `buildTopology()` method, which uses the Kafka Streams DSL.

The first thing the method does is create an instance of `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/StreamsBuilder.html[StreamsBuilder]`, which is the helper object that lets us build our topology. With our builder in hand, there are three things we need to do. First, we call the `stream()` method to create a `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html[KStream]<String, Movie>` object. The problem is that we can't make any assumptions about the key of this stream, so we have to repartition it explicitly. We use the `map()` method for that, creating a new `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/KeyValue.html[KeyValue]` instance for each record, using the movie ID as the new key.

The movies start their life in a stream, but fundamentally, movies are entities that belong in a table. To turn them into a table, we first emit the rekeyed stream to a Kafka topic using the `to()` method. We can then use the `builder.table()` method to create a `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KTable.html[KTable]<String,Movie>`. We have successfully turned a topic full of movie entities into a scalable, key-addressable table of `Movie` objects. With that, we're ready to move on to ratings.

Creating the `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html[KStream]<String,Rating>` of ratings looks just like our first step with the movies: we create a stream from the topic, then repartition it with the `map()` method. Note that we must choose the same key—movie ID—for our join to work.

With the ratings stream and the movie table in hand, all that remains is to join them using the `join()` method. It's a wonderfully simply one-liner, but we have concealed a bit of complexity in the form of the `MovieRatingJoiner` class. More on that in a moment.
