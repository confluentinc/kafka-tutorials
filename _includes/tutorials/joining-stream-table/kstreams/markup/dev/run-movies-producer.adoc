In a new terminal, run:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer-movies.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input. Copy and paste one line at a time and press enter to send it. Note that these lines contain hard tabs between the key and the value, so retyping them without the tab will not work.

Each line represents a movie we will be able to rate. To send all of the events below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/joining-stream-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/movies.json %}</code></pre>
+++++

In this case the table data originates from a Kafka topic that was populated by a console producer but this doesn't always have to be the case. You can use Kafka Connect to stream data from a source system (such as a database) into a Kafka topic, which could then be the foundation for a lookup table.
