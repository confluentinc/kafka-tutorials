[NOTE]
.Populating Data
====
One fundamental operation for working with tables is populating them with data. There are a number of ways to do this:

 * Use ksqlDB's `INSERT INTO VALUES` syntax.
 * Use the Apache Kafka® clients to write data to the underlying topics.
 * Use connectors to source data from external systems.

This tutorial uses ksqlDB `INSERT INTO VALUES` syntax. For an example on how to use the Apache Kafka® clients to write data to the underlying topics, see link:https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/creating-first-apache-kafka-producer-application/kafka.html[*building your first Kafka producer application*] and for an example on how to use connectors to source data from external systems, see link:https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/connect-add-key-to-source/ksql.html[*creating a ksqlDB table from PostgresSQL data using Kafka Connect*].
