Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/AggregatingSum.java`. Let's take a close look at the `buildTopology()` method, which uses the Kafka Streams DSL.

The first thing the method does is create an instance of `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/StreamsBuilder.html[StreamsBuilder]`, which is the helper object that lets us build our topology. With our builder in hand, we can apply the following methods:

1. Call the `stream()` method to create a `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html[KStream]<String, TicketSale>` object.

2. Since we can't make any assumptions about the key of this stream, we have to repartition it explicitly. We use the `map()` method for that, creating a new `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/KeyValue.html[KeyValue]` instance for each record, using the movie title as the new key.

3. Group the events by that new key by calling the `groupByKey()` method. This returns a `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KGroupedStream.html[KGroupedStream]` object.

4. Use the `reduce()` method to apply the sum aggregation.

5. Use the `toStream()` method to produce the sum results to the specified output topic.
