To check that it's working, print out the contents of the output stream's underlying topic:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-sum/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-sum/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that ksqlDB is storing the `TITLE` in the key of the Kafka message. It does this because `TITLE` is the primary key of the `MOVIE_REVENUE` table.
If needed, a copy of `TITLE` can also be stored in the value by adding `AsValue(TITLE)` in the projection.
