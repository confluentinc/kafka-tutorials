Creating the multi-way joined stream uses common SQL join syntax. 

You define the fields you want to materialize in the stream with the `SELECT` keyword, followed by `source.field` identifiers.  The `FROM` keyword identifies the stream to base events off of and the `JOIN` keywords identifies the joined tables and field relationships.

Joining "N" sources is equivalent to performing "N" joins consecutively, and the order of the joins is controlled by the order in which the joins are written. The multi-way join is subject to limitations and restrictions of each regular intermediate step join. See the https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/joins/join-streams-and-tables/#join-capabilities[ksqlDB documentation for the full details on joins].
