To check that it's working, print out the contents of one of the output stream's underlying topic.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/splitting/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/splitting/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-outputs/printed-topic.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Try dropping the `LIMIT` from the print command so that it runs indefinitely. To see how any new message on the source stream is automatically routed to the correct target stream, open a new CLI session and insert a record like we did above.
