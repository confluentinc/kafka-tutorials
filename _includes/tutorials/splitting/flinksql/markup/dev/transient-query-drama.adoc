With our test data in place, let's execute a query to find all of the actor / movie combinations for drama films.

This query will continue to return results until you quit by entering `Q`.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/splitting/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query-drama.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/splitting/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-drama.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Enter `Q` to return to the Flink SQL prompt.

Note that these results were materialized in memory and printed in a human-readable table representation because the default `sql-client.execution.result-mode` configuration value is `'table'`. You can view non-materialized streaming results as a changelog by running `SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'changelog';`
and rerunning the same query. The results will look like this:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/splitting/flinksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-query-changelog-drama.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Or, as a third option, you can see streaming results non-materialized and inline in the SQL client by running ``SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'tableau';`` and rerunning the query once more. In this case, the results will look very similar to `changelog` mode results. This is because tables sourced by the Kafka connector are _unbounded_ and can thus only be queried in `streaming` mode.
