In this file you describe the Kafka streams topology, and should cover the main points of the tutorial.
The text assumes a method buildTopology exists and constructs the Kafka Streams application.  Feel free to modify the text below to suit your needs.

The focus of this tutorial is using attributes in the output records to determine the correct output topic.  For sending fully-processed records, typically you would use the `KStream.to()` method, which takes the name of the output topic. You can think of this as setting the output topic statically.

For dynamic output topic choice, Kafka Streams has an overloaded version of the `KStream.to()` method that takes a `TopicNameExtractor` interface instead of a singular topic name.  The `TopicNameExtractor` interface contains only one method, `extract`. This means you can use a lambda in most cases, instead of a concrete class.

The `TopicNameExtractor.extract()` method accepts three parameters: the key, value, and `RecordContext` of the current record. It returns a `String` â€“ the output topic to use.

Now take a detailed look at the `TopicNameExtractor` you'll use in this tutorial (found on line 67 in `DynamicOutputTopic.java`)

In the code above, the `TopicNameExtractor` takes the `CompletedOrder.id` field. Based on the extracted substring, it returns the name of the topic to use.  You should also note that the topics need to be created ahead of time as with any of the topics used by Kafka Streams.




Now go ahead and create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/DynamicOutputTopic.java`.
