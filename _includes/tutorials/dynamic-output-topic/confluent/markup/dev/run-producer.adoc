   Example content file for how to include a console produer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

In a new terminal, run:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/dynamic-output-topic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/ccloud-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You will be prompted for the Confluent Cloud Schema Registry credentials as shown below, which you can find in the `configuration/ccloud.properties` configuration file.
Look for the configuration parameter `basic.auth.user.info`, whereby the ":" is the delimiter between the key and secret.

```
Enter your Schema Registry API key:
Enter your Schema Registry API secret:
```

When the producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input. Each line represents input data for the Kafka Streams application.
To send all of the events below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/dynamic-output-topic/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input.json %}</code></pre>
