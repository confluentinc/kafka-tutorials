  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Now that you have produced some orders, you should set up a consumer to view the results. In this case, you need to start two consumers as the Kafka Streams
application dynamically chooses which output topic to use depending on information contained in the `Order` object.

In a new terminal window start the following console consumer to view regular sized `Order` objects.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/dynamic-output-topic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/ccloud-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>

You should see output that looks like this:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/dynamic-output-topic/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.json %}</code></pre>
