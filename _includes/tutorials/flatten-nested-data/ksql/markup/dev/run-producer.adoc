Before we move foward with the implementation, we need to produce records to the `ORDERS` stream.
Let's use the console producer to create some records.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/flatten-nested-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts, it will log some messages and hang, waiting for your input.
Type in one line at a time and press enter to send it.
Each line represents an order of one 'Highly Durable Glue' bought by each member of Confluent's developer advocacy team.
Note that each order contains the fields `customer` and `product` that in turn contains nested data.
To send all orders below, click on the clipboard icon on the right, then paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/flatten-nested-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-events.json %}</code></pre>
