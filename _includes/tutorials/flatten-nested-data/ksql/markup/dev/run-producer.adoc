<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/flatten-nested-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>

Note that each order contains the fields `customer` and `product` that in turn contains nested data.
To send all orders below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/flatten-nested-data/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-events.json %}</code></pre>
