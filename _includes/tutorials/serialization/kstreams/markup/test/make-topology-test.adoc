Now create the following file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/serialization/SerializationTutorialTest.java`. 
Testing a Kafka streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this easy.

There is only one method in `SerializationTutorialTest` annotated with `@Test`, and that is `shouldChangeSerializationFormat()`. 
This method actually runs our Streams topology using the `https://kafka.apache.org/{{ site.ak_javadoc_version }}/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/TopologyTestDriver.html[TopologyTestDriver]` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
