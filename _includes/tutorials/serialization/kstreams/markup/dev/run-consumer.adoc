Before you start producing input data, it's a good idea to set up the consumer on the output topic. 
This way, as soon as you produce movie in different format (Avro), you'll see the results right away.
Notice that we're using the `kafka-avro-console-consumer` tool to do that. Kafka ships with a specialized
command line consumer out of the box to read Avro formatted messages. Run this to get ready to consume the records:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/serialization/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You won't see any results until the next step.
