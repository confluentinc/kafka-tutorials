Before you start producing input data, it's a good idea to set up the consumer on the output topic. 
This way, as soon as you produce movie in different format (Protobuf), you'll see the results right away.

NOTE: We're using the `kafka-protobuf-console-consumer` tool to do that. 
Confluent Platform ships with a specialized command line consumer out of the box to read Protobuf formatted messages. 

Run this to get ready to consume the records:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/serialization/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You won't see any results until the next step.
