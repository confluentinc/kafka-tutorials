To check that it's working, print out the contents of the output stream's underlying topic:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/serialization/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

Note: the topic name needs to be quoted as it contains invalid characters, namely the '-'.

This should yield the following output:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/serialization/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice the 'Value format' is reported as `PROTOBUF`.

Congrats! You've taken a topic formatted with Avro and created a continuously updating copy on a new topic in Protobuf.
