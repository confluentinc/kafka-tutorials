To check that it's working, print out the contents of the output stream's underlying topic:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/serialization/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-output-topic.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

This should yield the following output:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/serialization/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-print.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Congrats! You've taken a topic formatted with JSON and created a continuously updating copy on a new topic in Avro.
