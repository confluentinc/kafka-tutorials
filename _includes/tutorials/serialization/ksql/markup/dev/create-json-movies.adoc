The first thing we'll need is to create a Kafka topic and stream to represent the movie data. We declare the `VALUE_FORMAT` of the stream to be `json` to denote the format of the events.
The stream stores the movie's id, `MOVIE_ID`, in the Kafka message's key, but could just as easily store it in a the value if we removed the `KEY` classifier.
