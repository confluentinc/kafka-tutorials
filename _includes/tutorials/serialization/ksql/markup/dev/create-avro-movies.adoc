To convert the events to Avro, we're going to create a derived stream.
All that is needed is to specify the `VALUE_FORMAT` as `avro`, and the conversion will happen automatically.
You can also optionally specify the topic name as we've done here. Omitting this parameter will cause the underlying topic to be named the same as the stream name.

Because this is a continuous query, any new records arriving on the source in JSON (`json-movies`) will be automatically converted to Avro on the derived topic (`avro-movies`).
