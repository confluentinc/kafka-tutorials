Now we'll add the connector plugin to Confluent Cloud. We're not actually running the connector in this step; we're just uploading the plugin so that we can run the connector in the next section.

Go ahead and create a Kafka cluster in the Confluent Cloud Console if you didn't already do so link:#provision-your-kafka-cluster[above]. Your Kafka cluster *must* reside in a https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/bring-your-connector/custom-connector-fands.html#cc-byoc-regions[supported cloud provider and region] in order for you to be able to upload the plugin to Confluent Cloud.

On the cluster homepage, select `Connectors` from the lefthand navigation, and then click the `Add plugin` button on the top right.

Fill in the form as follows:

1. Name: `Counter Source`
2. Description: `Source connector that emits incrementing numbers`
3. Connector class: the class that extends Kafka Connect's `SourceConnector` class, i.e., `io.confluent.developer.connect.CounterConnector`
4. Connector type: Select `Source`
5. Click `Select connector archive` and choose the zip file built in the previous step
6. Sensitive properties: leave this section alone since the connector doesn't make use of any sensitive properties like credentials to connect to an external system
7. Review the custom connector disclaimer and check the box agreeing that you are responsible for the code uploaded to Confluent Cloud
8. Click `Submit`!
