Now we'll add the connector plugin to Confluent Cloud. We're not actually provisioning a connector just yet, but making the connector available for provisioning.

Go ahead and create a Kafka cluster in the Confluent Cloud Console if you didn't already do so link:#provision-your-kafka-cluster[above].

On the cluster homepage, select `Connectors` from the lefthand navigation, and then click the `Add plugin` button on the top right.  Fill in the form as follows:

1. Name: `Counter Source`
2. Description: `Source connector that emits incrementing numbers`
3. Connector class: the class that extends Kafka Connect's `SourceConnector` class, i.e., `io.confluent.developer.connect.CounterConnector`
4. Connector type: Select `Source`
5. Click `Select connector archive` and choose the zip file built in the previous step
5. Sensitive properties: leave this section alone since the connector doesn't make use of any sensitive properties like credentials to connect to an external system
6. Review the custom connector disclaimer and check the box agreeing that you are responsible for the code uploaded to Confluent Cloud
7. Click `Submit`!
