Next, let's open up a console consumer again. This time you'll read everything your producer has sent to the topic you created in the previous step.

Run this command in the container shell you created for your first consumer and note the additional property `--from-beginning`:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-from-beginning.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After the consumer starts you should see the following output in a few seconds:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-step-two.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++


One word of caution with using the `--from-beginning` flag. As the name implies this setting forces the consumer retrieve _**every record**_ currently on the topic.  So it's best to use when testing  and learning and not on a production topic.

Again, once you've received all records, close this console consumer by entering a `CTRL+C`.
