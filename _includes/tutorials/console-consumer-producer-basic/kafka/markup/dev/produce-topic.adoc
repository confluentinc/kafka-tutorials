To produce your first record into Kafka, open another terminal window and run the following command to open a second shell on the broker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

From inside the second terminal on the broker container, run the following command to start a console producer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The producer will start and wait for you to enter input.  Each line represents one record and to send it you'll hit the enter key.  If you type multiple words and then hit enter, the entire line is considered one record.

Try typing one line at a time, hit enter and go back to the console consumer window and look for the output. Or, you can select all the records and send at one time.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-step-one.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++


Once you've sent all the records you should see the same output in your console consumer window. After you've confirmed receiving all records, go ahead and close the consumer by entering `CTRL+C`.
