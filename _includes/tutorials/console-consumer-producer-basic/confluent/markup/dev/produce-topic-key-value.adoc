Now we are going to produce records to our new topic using the schema created a few steps back. Open a second terminal window and start the producer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/produce.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The producer will start with some information and then wait for you to enter input.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/produce_expected.log %}</code></pre>
+++++

Below are example records in JSON format with each line representing a single record.

Copy each line and paste it into the producer terminal, pressing enter after each one to produce the new record. 

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/records.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

As you produce records you can observe them in the consumer terminal.
