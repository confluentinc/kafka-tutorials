<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/view-ccloud-config.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your output should resemble:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-producer-basic/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/sample-stack.cfg %}</code></pre>
