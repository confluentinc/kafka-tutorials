If you have real end systems to connect to, adapt the sample connector configuration(s) below and run them from ksqlDB with `CREATE SOURCE CONNECTOR`.

The concept in this tutorial can be applicable to any of the traditional message systems (RabbitMQ, Tibco, IBM MQ, ActiveMQ, etc.), and this specific tutorial uses the link:https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-rabbitmq-source.html[RabbitMQ Source Connector for Confluent Cloud] which uses the AMQP protocol to communicate with RabbitMQ servers and persists the data in a Kafka topic.
