We can now query our Postgres database to verify that the connector is working as expected. Enter the following command into the command line, not the ksqlDB CLI:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="bash">{% include_raw tutorials/connect-sink-timestamp/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/query-sink.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="log">{% include_raw tutorials/connect-sink-timestamp/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/query-sink-output.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
