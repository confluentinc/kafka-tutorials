   Example content file for how to include a console producer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

////

To get started, let's first open a shell on the container broker.  You'll use the broker shell for running a console producer and consumer throughout the tutorial.
Open a new terminal window and run the following command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/streams-to-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


Then let's run the following command in the broker container shell from the previous step to start a new console producer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/streams-to-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


Then enter these records either one at time or copy-paste all of them into the terminal and hit enter:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/streams-to-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

After you've sent the records, you can close the producer with `Ctrl-C`, but keep the broker container shell open as you'll still need it for the next few steps.
