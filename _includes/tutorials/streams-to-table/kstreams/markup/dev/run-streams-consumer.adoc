  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results

Now that you've sent the records to your Kafka Streams application, let's look that the output.  You've built a simple application so we don't expect to see anything special, but you did convert a `KStream` to a `KTable`.  A `KStream` is an event-stream meaning Kafka Streams forwards every record downstream.  But a `KTable`
 is an update-stream which means Kafka Streams only forwards the latest _**update**_ for a given key.

We'll observe this in action in the next two steps.  In this step, you'll examine the output of the `KStream` and you should expect to see six output records which corresponds to the six input records you published before.

Run the following command to see the output of the event-stream:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/streams-to-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/streams-console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After a few seconds you should see output like the following:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/streams-to-table/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-streams-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Now that you've confirmed the streams output, close this consumer with a `CTRL+C`.
