At the end, you should be able to see the output count for the key 101 and the key 102.

Here the logging time match the time of the latest result: `05:46:03`. This latest result for the sensor 000 advance the
stream time and a final result gets produced for all window having a *terminated grace period*. Hours are printed in
the default system time zone. So it was between `05:45:20` and `05:45:30` for me when the sensor 301 experienced 2
pressure alerts. To start investigate on what happened, I would need the time zone of that sensor.
