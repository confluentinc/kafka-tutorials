Add the config file `src/main/resources/application.conf` to setup your application:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="hocon">{%
    include_raw tutorials/window-final-result/kstreams/code/src/main/resources/application.conf
%}</code></pre>
+++++

You may want to adapt the blocks `local.date.lang` and `local.date.pattern`

This file contains default configs. In production they will be overridden by environment variables.
