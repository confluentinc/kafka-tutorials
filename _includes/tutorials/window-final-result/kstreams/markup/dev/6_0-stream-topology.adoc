In the main function we create https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#windowing[time-based windows]
with a given size and the same step size. This results in non-overlapping windows called
https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksql-queries.html#tumbling-window[Tumbling Windows].
Also we add a extra period were even if messages come late, if their datetime key correspond to a window they may join
the window. Finally we pass this window, to a function that takes also `StreamsBuilder` and return a `Topology`.
Add the next class at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/WindowFinalResult.java` package.

Here are several notes about the `WindowFinalResult#buildTopology` function:

- To consume events, we create a `SpecificAvroSerde` based on the generated source code in part 3.
- The serde used to produce aggregated result is a windowed serde. It will store the key but also the window start time.
- Our custom timestamp extractor is added thank to the `Consumed#withTimestampExtractor` method.

Then we stream, selectKey and groupByKey and finally apply the *Suppress* operator.

The suppress operator will delete every intermediate change once the grace period is over. By doing so it will also
emit the final result

*Note*: even after suppress operator applied, you will need the next event to advance the
https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/concepts.html#time[stream time]
and get your result.
