Finally, launch the container using your preferred container orchestration service.

If you want to run it locally and pass your custom configuration file, you can execute the following:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="bash">{%
    include_raw tutorials/window-final-result/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/prod/launch-container-conf-file.sh
%}</code></pre>
+++++

*Or*, just run the container and set the environment variables you'd like to change:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="bash">{%
    include_raw tutorials/window-final-result/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/prod/launch-container-env-var.sh
%}</code></pre>
+++++
