Now run a console consumer that will read topics from the output topic to confirm your application published the expected records.

```bash
confluent kafka topic consume output-topic --print-key --delimiter " : " --from-beginning
```

The output from the consumer can vary if you added any of your own records, but it should look something like this:

++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-producer-application-callback/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
++++


Now close the consumer with `Ctrl-C` then the broker shell with `Ctrl-D`.
