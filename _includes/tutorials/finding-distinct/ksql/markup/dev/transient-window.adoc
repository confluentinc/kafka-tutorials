Let's experiment with these events. We need to create a query capable of displaying only distinct events, which means that duplicate IP addresses should be filtered out. Events are de-duped within a 2 minute window, and only unique clicks will be shown on that window. We are going to use the `LIMIT` keyword to limit the amount of records shown in the output. If you want to experiment with this query and assess if it is displaying the correct results, go ahead and remove the limit keyword.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-window.sql %}</code></pre>

This query should produce the following output:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-window.log%}</code></pre>
