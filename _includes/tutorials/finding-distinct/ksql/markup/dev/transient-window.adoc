Let's experiment with these events.

First, let's create a query to select the information we need and count each occurance of an IP address.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-window.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

And it should produce the following output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-transient-window.log%}</code></pre>
+++++

Notice that the duplicate IP addresses have an `IP_COUNT` value greater than one.  So our next step is to filter out the duplicates by only selecting records where the `IP_COUNT` column equals `1`.
