In the first statement above, we created the query that finds only distinct events, naming it `DETECTED_CLICKS`. We modeled it as a table since the query performs aggregations.

Then, with the next two statements, we specified a re-keying to ensure that the `IP_ADDRESS` is used as key of the record, by transforming the table back to a stream and using the `PARTITION BY` clause.

To verify everything is working as expected, run the following query:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="sql">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/transient-query.sql %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output should look similar to:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/ksql/code/tutorial-steps/dev/outputs/transient-query/output-0.log %}</code></pre>
+++++
