There are a couple of important points to note in the Gradle build file:

. Java `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` are set to Java 11. Flink supports Java 8 (deprecated) and 11 as of the writing of this tutorial
. The `dependencies` section declares test dependencies for Testcontainers and Flink. Among the handful of Flink dependencies are ones providing local execution (e.g., `flink-statebackend-rocksdb`), the Table API (`flink-table-api-java-bridge`), and Kafka connectors (`flink-sql-connector-kafka`).
