Create the following test file at `src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/FindDistinctEventsTest.java`. Testing a Kafka Streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant than it would otherwise be.

There is a test method in `FindDistinctEventsTest` annotated with `@Test`: `shouldFilterDistinctEvents()` which follows the common Arrange Act Assert (AAA) pattern.  This is a simple method that runs our Streams topology using the `TopologyTestDriver` and some mocked data that is set up inside the test method.
