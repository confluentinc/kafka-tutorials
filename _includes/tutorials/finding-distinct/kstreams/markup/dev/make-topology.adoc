Then create the following file at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/FindDistinctEvents.java`

Focusing on the `buildTopology` method, note how the Kafka Streams topology relies on a `https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/javadocs/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/ValueTransformerWithKey.html[ValueTransformerWithKey]` and a `https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/javadocs/org/apache/kafka/streams/state/WindowStore.html[Window Store]` to filter out the duplicate IP addresses.   Events are de-duped within a 2 minute window, and unique clicks are produced to a new topic named `distinct-clicks`.

*_Note that we are using `https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/javadocs/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/ValueTransformerWithKey.html[ValueTransformerWithKey]` here instead of `https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/javadocs/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/Transformer.html[Transformer]` since we need keys to transform data, but there is no need to re-key the stream. 
`Tranformer` usage will lead to redundant repartitioning when grouping operations are used afterwards._*
