In a new terminal, run:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/finding-distinct/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

When the console producer starts it may log some informational messages, and then it will pause, waiting to read input from the terminal. Below are sample events you can paste into the terminal one at a time. Press enter to send each record after pasting. (Note: if the client encounters a SerializationException, that's likely because a stray newline was included in the pasted content.)

In the next steps we will run a consumer to observe the distinct click events. You can experiment with various orderings of the records in order to observe what makes a click event distinct. By default the distinct event window store looks for distinct clicks over a 2-minute duration.
