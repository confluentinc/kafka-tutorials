Now you'll use a topic created in the previous step.
Your focus here is reading values on the command line with the console consumer.
The records have the format of `key = Long` and `value = Double`.

First let's open a new terminal window and start a shell in the broker container:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-primitive-keys-values/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/open-docker-shell.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Now let's start up a console consumer to read some records. Run this command in the container shell:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-primitive-keys-values/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer-keys.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

After the consumer starts up, you'll get some output, but nothing readable is on the screen.  You should see something similar to this:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-primitive-keys-values/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output-step-one.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output looks like this because you are consuming records with a `Long` key and a `Double` value, but you haven't provided the correct deserializer for longs or doubles.

Close the consumer with a `Ctrl+C` command, but keep the container shell open.
