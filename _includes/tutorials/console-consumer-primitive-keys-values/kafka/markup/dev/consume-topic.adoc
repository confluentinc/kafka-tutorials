In this tutorial, you'll use a topic that the `docker-compose` step populates ahead of time.  Your focus here is the reading values on the command line with the console consumer.  The records have the format of `key = Long` and `value = Double`.

Now let's start up a console consumer to read some records.  Open a new terminal window run this command:
+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-primitive-keys-values/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The consumer will start up and block waiting for records, you won't see any output until after the next step.
