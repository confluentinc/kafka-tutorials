To produce your first record into Kafka, open a terminal window an run the following command:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-primitive-keys-values/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The producer will start and wait for you to enter input.  Each line represents one record and to send it you'll hit the enter key.  If you type multiple words then hit enter, the entire line is considered one record.

Try typing one line at a time, hit enter and go back to the console consumer window and look for the output. Or you can select all the records and send at one time.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/console-consumer-primitive-keys-values/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input-step-one.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++


Once you've sent all the records you should see the same output in your console consumer window. After you've confirmed recieving all records go ahead and close the consumer by entering `CTRL+C`.
