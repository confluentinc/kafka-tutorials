  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Now that you've run the Kafka Streams application, it should have shut it self down due to reaching the max-error threshold.

Let's now run the `kafka-console-consumer` to confirm the output:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/error-handling/kstreams/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

Your results should look something like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
ALL
ALL
STREAMS
LEAD
TO
CONFLUENT
ALL
STREAMS
LEAD
TO
CONFLUENT
GO
Processed a total of 12 messages
</code></pre>
++++

You'll notice there are some duplicated values in the output.  This duplication is to be expected, as the streams application is running with the default processing mode of `AT_LEAST_ONCE`. Duplicate values is one thing to consider when using `REPLACE_THREAD` with the `StreamsUncaughtExceptionHander`, since this is analogous to using retries with the `KafkaProducer`.  If you don't want duplicate values, you should consider running with the processing mode of `EXACTLY_ONCE`
