  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results

Now that you've run the Kafka Streams application, it should have shut itself down due to reaching the max-error threshold.

Let's now run the Confluent CLI to confirm the output:

```plaintext
confluent kafka topic consume output-topic --from-beginning
```

Your results should look something like this:
++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">
ALL
ALL
STREAMS
LEAD
TO
CONFLUENT
ALL
STREAMS
LEAD
TO
CONFLUENT
GO
</code></pre>
++++

You'll notice there are some duplicated values in the output.  This duplication is to be expected, as the streams application is running with the default processing mode of `AT_LEAST_ONCE`. Duplicate values is one thing to consider when using `REPLACE_THREAD` with the `StreamsUncaughtExceptionHander`, since this is analogous to using retries with the `KafkaProducer`.  If you don't want duplicate values, you should consider running with the processing mode of `EXACTLY_ONCE`

Enter `Ctrl-C` to exit.
