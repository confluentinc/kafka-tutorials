Run a console consumer to read all the messages from `myTopic` to confirm the producer published the expected records.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/message-ordering/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/test/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output from the consumer can vary if you added any of your own records, but it should look something like below.
Notice that the messages are not in orderâ€”this is expected!
This illustrates that message order is not maintained across topic partitions, it only maintains message order per partition.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/message-ordering/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/test/expected-output-consumer-all-partitions.txt %}</code></pre>

Close the consumer with a `CTRL+C` then the broker shell with a `CTRL+D`
