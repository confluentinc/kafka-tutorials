Run a console consumer to read all the messages from `myTopic` to confirm the producer published the expected records.

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/message-ordering/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/test/console-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

The output from the consumer should look something like below.
Notice that the messages are not in order—this is expected!
This illustrates that for the consumer, message order is not maintained across topic partitions, it is only maintained per partition (as we will see in the next few steps).

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/message-ordering/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/test/expected-output-consumer-all-partitions.txt %}</code></pre>

Close the consumer with a `Ctrl-C`.
