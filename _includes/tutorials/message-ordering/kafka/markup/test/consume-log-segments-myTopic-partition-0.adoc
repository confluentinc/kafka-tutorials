Now let's look at the Kafka broker's log segment files using the `kafka-dump-log` administrative tool.
First, examine partition 0, indicated by the `0` in `myTopic-0`.

You should see:

Note the familiar `producerId: 0`, which corresponds to the earlier log output from the producer application run.
(If the producer were not configured to be idempotent, this would show `producerId: -1`.)

Also observe that each message has a unique sequence number, starting with `sequence: 0` through `sequence: 8`, that are not duplicated and are all in order.
The broker checks the sequence number to ensure idempotency per partition, such that if a producer experiences a retriable exception and resends a message, sequence numbers will not be duplicated or out of order in the committed log.
(If the producer were not configured to be idempotent, the messages would show `sequence: -1`.)
