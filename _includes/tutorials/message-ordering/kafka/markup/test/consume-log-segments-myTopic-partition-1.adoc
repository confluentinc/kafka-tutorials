Now let's look at the Kafka broker's log files using the `DumpLogSegments` utility, 
Dump the logs from the topic's partition 1.

You should see:

Note the familiar `producerId: 0`, which corresponds to the earlier log output when we ran the producer application.
(If the producer were not idempotent, you would see `producerId: -1`.)

Also observe that each messages has a unique sequence number, startinging with `sequence: 0` through `sequence: 11`.
This sequence number is how the broker detects ensures idempotency (if there are retries) and ordered messages (if sequences numbers are sent out of sequence).
(If the producer were not idempotent, you would see `sequence: -1`.)
