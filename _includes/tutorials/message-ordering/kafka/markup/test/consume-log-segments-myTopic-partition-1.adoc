Now, let's use the `DumpLogSegments` utility again to examine partition 1, indicated by the `1` in `myTopic-1`.

You should see:

Note the familiar `producerId: 0`, which corresponds to the earlier log output when we ran the producer application.
(If the producer were not idempotent, you would see `producerId: -1`.)

Also observe that each message has a unique sequence number, starting with `sequence: 0` through `sequence: 2`.
This sequence number is how the broker detects ensures idempotency per partition (if there are retries) and ordered messages (if sequences numbers are sent out of sequence).
(If the producer were not idempotent, you would see `sequence: -1`.)
