Before you create your full application code, let's highlight some of the most important `ProducerConfig` configuration parameters relevant to the idempotent producer:

The following parameter is *required* to be explicitly configured:

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#enable.idempotence[enable.idempotence]: when set to `true`, it enables an idempotent producer which ensures that exactly one copy of each message is written to the brokers, and in order.
  The default value is `enable.idempotence=false`, so you must explicitly set this to `enable.idempotence=true`.

The other parameters may not be required to be explicitly set, but there are some noteworthy caveats:

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#acks[acks]: the `KafkaProducer` uses the `acks` configuration to tell the leader broker how many acknowledgments to wait for to consider a produce request complete.
  This value must be `acks=all` for the idempotent producer to work, otherwise the producer cannot guarantee idempotence.
  The default value is `acks=1`, so you have two choices: (a) do not explicitly set it in the configuration and allow the producer automatically override it, or (b) explicitly set this to `acks=all`.
  The producer will fail to start if `enable.idempotence=true` and your application configures this to anything but `acks=all`.

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#max.in.flight.requests.per.connection[max.in.flight.requests.per.connection]: the maximum number of unacknowledged requests the producer sends on a single connection before blocking.
  The idempotent producer still maintains message order even with pipelining (i.e., `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` can be greater than 1), and the maximum value supported with idempotency is 5. The default value is already `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5`, so no change is required for the idempotent producer.

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#retries[retries]: setting a value greater than zero will cause the producer to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. 
  The only requirement for idempotency is that this is greater than zero.
  The default value is already `retries=2147483647`, so no change is required for the idempotent producer.

This is only a small subset of producer configuration parameters focused on idempotent producer semantics.
For further reading, please see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging#KIP98ExactlyOnceDeliveryandTransactionalMessaging-IdempotentProducerGuarantees[KIP-98].
This KIP also discusses other elements of exactly once semantics (EOS), including transactional guarantees which enable applications to produce to multiple partitions atomically, ie. all writes across multiple partitions can succeed or fail as a unit.

Now let's create the application source code at `src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaProducerApplication.java`.
