Let's do a quick walkthrough of some of the producer properties.

https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#enable.idempotence[enable.idempotence] - When set to 'true', the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. 

https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#max.in.flight.requests.per.connection[max.in.flight.requests.per.connection] - The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking.

https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#retries[retries] - Prevent the producer from resending failed requests.

This is only a small sub-set of producer configuration parameters. The full list of producer configuration parameters can be found in the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Apache Kafka documentation].
