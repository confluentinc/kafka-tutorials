Let's do a quick walkthrough of some producer properties.

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#enable.idempotence[enable.idempotence] - When set to `true`, the producer ensures that exactly one copy of each message is written. The default value is `enable.idempotence=false`, so you must explicitly set this to `enable.idempotence=true`.

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#acks[acks] - The `KafkaProducer` uses the `acks` configuration to tell the lead broker how many acknowledgments to wait for to consider a produce request complete. You must set `acks=all` in order to use the idempotent producer, otherwise the producer cannot guarantee idempotence. The default value is `acks=1`, so you must explicitly set this to `acks=all`.

* https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#max.in.flight.requests.per.connection[max.in.flight.requests.per.connection] - The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the producer sends on a single connection before blocking. The idempotent producer still maintains message order even with pipelining (i.e., `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` can be greater than `1`), and the maximum value supported with idempotency is `5`. The default value is already `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5`, so no change is required for the idempotent producer to maintain message order and to prevent duplication.

This is only a small sub-set of producer configuration parameters. The full list of producer configuration parameters can be found in the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Apache Kafka documentation].
