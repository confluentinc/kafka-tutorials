   Example content file for how to include a console produer(s) in the tutorial.
   Usually you'll include a line referencing the script to run the console producer and also include some content
   describing how to input data as shown below.

   Again modify this file as you need for your tutorial, as this is just sample content.  You also may have more than one
   console producer to run depending on how you structure your tutorial

Using the terminal window you opened in step three, run the following command to start a console-producer:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/console-producer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++


Each line represents input data for the KafkaConsumer application.  To send all of the events below, paste the following into the prompt and press enter:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="json">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/input.txt %}</code></pre>
