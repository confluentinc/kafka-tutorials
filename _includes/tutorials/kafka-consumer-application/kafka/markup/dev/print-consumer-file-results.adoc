  This is a sample content file for how to include a console consumer to the tutorial, probably a good idea so the end user can watch the results
  of the tutorial.  Change the text as needed.

Your consumer application should have consumed all the records sent and written them out to a file.

In a new terminal, run this command to print the results to the console:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/print-consumer-file-results.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see something like this:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/kafka-consumer-application/kafka/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++
