Then create a development configuration file at `configuration/dev.properties`:

Let's do a quick overview of some of the more important properties here:

The `key.deserializer` and `value.deserializer` properties provide a class implementing the `Deserializer` interface for converting `byte` arrays into the expected object type of the key and value respectively.

The `max.poll.interval.ms` is the maximum amount of time a consumer may take between calls to `Consumer.poll()`.  If a consumer instance takes longer than the specified time, it's considered non-responsive and removed from the consumer-group triggering a rebalance.

Setting `enable.auto.commit` configuration to `true` enables the Kafka consumer to handle committing offsets automatically for you.  The default setting is `true`, but it's included here to make it explicit.  When you enable auto commit, you need to ensure you've processed all records _**before**_ the consumer calls `poll` again.  Once there is a subsequent call to `poll`, all the records returned from the previous call are considered processed and the consumer commits the offsets.

`auto.offset.reset` - If a consumer instance can't locate any offsets for its topic-partition assignment(s), it will resume processing from the _**earliest**_ available offset.

`group.id` - Kafka uses the concept of a consumer-group which is used to represent a logical single group.  A consumer-group can be made up of multiple members all sharing the same `group.id` configuration.  As members leave or join the consumer-group, the group-coordinator triggres a rebalance which causes topic-partition reassignment among active members of the group.
