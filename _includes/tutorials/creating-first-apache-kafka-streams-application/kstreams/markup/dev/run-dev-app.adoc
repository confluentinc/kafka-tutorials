Now that you have an uberjar for the Kafka Streams application, you can launch it locally. When you run the following, the prompt won't return, because the application will run until you exit it. There is always another message to process, so streaming applications don't exit until you force them.

If the Kafka Streams application has started properly, you should see the debugging log output from the `peek` functions.

Something similar to:
```
[faker-StreamThread-1] INFO io.confluent.developer.KafkaStreamsApplication - Observed event: Chuck Norris does not get compiler errors, the language changes itself to accommodate Chuck Norris.
[faker-StreamThread-1] INFO io.confluent.developer.KafkaStreamsApplication - Transformed event: CHUCK NORRIS DOES NOT GET COMPILER ERRORS, THE LANGUAGE CHANGES ITSELF TO ACCOMMODATE CHUCK NORRIS.
[faker-StreamThread-1] INFO io.confluent.developer.KafkaStreamsApplication - Observed event: Chuck Norris can write infinite recursion functions... and have them return.
[faker-StreamThread-1] INFO io.confluent.developer.KafkaStreamsApplication - Transformed event: CHUCK NORRIS CAN WRITE INFINITE RECURSION FUNCTIONS... AND HAVE THEM RETURN.
```
