  This content file is used to describe how to add test code you developed in this tutorial.  You'll need to update the
  text to suit your test code.


////

Now create the following file at +++<code class="copy-inline">src/test/java/io/confluent/developer/KafkaStreamsApplicationTest.java</code>+++. Testing a Kafka streams application requires a bit of test harness code, but happily the `org.apache.kafka.streams.TopologyTestDriver` class makes this much more pleasant that it would otherwise be.

////
             You'll want to update the name of the test method from "exampleTest" to something more meaningful for your tutorial
