Now that the Kafka Streams application is running, run a command line consumer using the `ccloud` CLI to view the events (your `ccloud` context should be set to the proper environment, cluster, and API Key (see Step 4 above and https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/command-reference/index.html[Confluent CLI Reference] for additional details).

Then, in a new terminal window, run the following console consumer to view the events being generated by the data generator and produced to the `random-strings` topic from the `Randomizer` class in your Kafka Streams application. These are the events that have been streamed into the topology (`.stream(inputTopic, Consumed.with(stringSerde, stringSerde)`).

<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/creating-first-apache-kafka-streams-application/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/ccloud-consumer.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see output that looks like this (notice the mixed case of the string):

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/creating-first-apache-kafka-streams-application/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-consume-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Next, look at the transformed events in the `tall-random-strings` topic. These are the events that have been transformed (`.mapValues`) and written to the output topic `.to(outputTopic, Produced.with(stringSerde, stringSerde))`.

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/creating-first-apache-kafka-streams-application/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/ccloud-consumer-transformed.sh %}</code></pre>
+++++

You should see output events that are entirely upper case:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="shell">{% include_raw tutorials/creating-first-apache-kafka-streams-application/confluent/code/tutorial-steps/dev/expected-consume-transformed-output.txt %}</code></pre>
+++++

Once you are done with observing the behavior of the application, stop the consumers and the Kafka Streams application with `Ctrl-C` in the appropriate terminal windows.
