With our test data and configuration parameters in place, let’s try a query to compute our ticket totals. A `SELECT` statement all by itself in KSQL is called a transient query, meaning that after we stop it, it is gone and will not keep processing the input stream. That's what we're doing in this step. The counterpart to a transient query is a _persistent_ query, which we'll create a few steps from now.

If you’re familiar with SQL, the text of the query itself is fairly self-explanatory. We are claculating the total number of records in each group, grouped by movie title. Note that `COUNT(TICKET_TOTAL_VALUE)` is still just counting the number of rows in the group, and is not doing any calculation based on ticket value itself. This is a standard SQL idiom that applies in KSQL as well.

This should yield the following output:
