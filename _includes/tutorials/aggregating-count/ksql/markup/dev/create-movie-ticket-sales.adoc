This tutorial takes a stream of individual movie ticket sales events and counts the total number of tickets sold per movie. Not all ticket prices are the same (apparently some of these theaters are fancier than others), but the task of the KSQL query is just to group and count regardless of ticket price.

This line of KSQL DDL creates a stream and its underlying Kafka topic to represent the annual sales totals. If the topic already exists, then KSQL simply registers is as the source of data underlying the new stream. The stream has three fields: `title`, the name of the movie; `sale_ts`, the time at which the ticket was sold; and `ticket_total_value`, the price paid for the ticket. The statement also the underlying Kafka topic as `movie-ticket-sales`, that it should have a single partition, and defines Avro as its data format.
