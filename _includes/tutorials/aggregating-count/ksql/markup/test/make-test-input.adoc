The Confluent ksqlDB CLI Docker image contains a program called the `ksql-test-runner`. We can pass this program a JSON file describing our desired input data, a JSON file containing the intended output results, and a file of ksqlDB queries to run, and it will tell us whether our queries successfully turn the input into the output. To get started, create a file at `test/input.json` with the inputs for testing
