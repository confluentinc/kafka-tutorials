This tutorial takes a stream of individual movie ticket sales events and counts the total number of tickets sold per movie. Not all ticket prices are the same (apparently some of these theaters are fancier than others), but the task of the Flink SQL query is just to group and count regardless of ticket price.

This line of Flink SQL DDL creates a table and its underlying Kafka topic to represent the annual sales totals.
Note that we are defining the schema for the table, which includes three fields: `title`, the name of the movie; `sale_ts`, the time at which the ticket was sold; and `ticket_total_value`, the price paid for the ticket. The statement also specifies the underlying Kafka topic as `movie-ticket-sales`, that it should have a single partition (the default `num.partitions` configured in the broker), and defines Avro as its data format.
