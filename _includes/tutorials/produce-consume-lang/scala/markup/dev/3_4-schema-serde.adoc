In this tutorial, events will be will be serialized in https://avro.apache.org/[Avro] format.
To do so, we will need the appropriate serializers/deserializers.
We add the following function to easily create a `Serializer[T]` where `T` in the type of the key or the value
we'd like to serialise. Add the class: `src/main/scala/io/confluent/developer/schema/ScalaReflectionSerde.scala`

In this tutorial we are going to use a reflection based serialization method using https://github.com/sksamuel/avro4s[Avro4s], which is a serializing/deserializing library for Avro written in Scala.
Avro4s performs it's de/serialization in multiple stages:
- For Serialization:        `Case Class Instance   ->  Generic Record -> Avro Formatted Bytes`
- For Deserialization:      `Avro Formatted bytes -> Generic Record -> Case Class Instance`
