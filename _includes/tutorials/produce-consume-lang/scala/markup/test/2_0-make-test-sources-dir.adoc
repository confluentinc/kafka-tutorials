Let's create a directory for the tests to live in:

<pre class="snippet"><code class="bash">{%
    include_raw tutorials/produce-consume-lang/scala/code/tutorial-steps/test/make-test-sources-dir.sh
%}</code></pre>
+++++

Before we go further we need to discuss *what* and *how* to test in these applications.

*What* to test? We don't want to test Kafka clients themselves. Instead, we'd like to test functions with
business behavior, even if they have side effects due to the call to Kafka producers / consumers.

*How* to test? On the opposite of most tutorials on this site, we are not testing a streaming application here,
which means we can not extract a streaming topology and test it separately.
We have to spawn a real Kafka broker to test our functions. And to do this we will use the
https://https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/kafka/[testcontainers] Kafka module.
